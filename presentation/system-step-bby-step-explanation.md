# Your Personal Data Vault: A Simple, Complete Explanation

Let me walk you through this entire system as if I'm explaining it to a friend over coffee. I'll cover every step, every component, and show you exactly how it all works.

---

## üéØ **What Problem Are We Solving?**

Imagine you're a busy professional. You have:
- WhatsApp messages from your team
- iMessages with your family
- Work emails about meetings
- Calendar invites for appointments

**The Problem:** Everything is scattered. You can't remember: "Wait, did Sarah mention the project deadline in WhatsApp, email, or iMessage?" You can't find the messages related to tomorrow's meeting.

**The Solution:** This system creates your **Personal Data Vault** - think of it as a private, encrypted library that:
1. Collects all your messages from everywhere
2. Understands what they mean (using AI)
3. Shows you connections ("These 5 messages are about your Friday meeting!")
4. Works on all your devices (iPhone, Mac, iPad)
5. Keeps everything 100% private and under your control

---

## üèóÔ∏è **The Big Picture: How It Works**

Think of this system in 3 layers:

### **Layer 1: Your Devices (iPhone, MacBook, iPad)**
- Each device has a local, encrypted database (like a secure filing cabinet)
- Your MacBook is the "coordinator" - it collects messages from all platforms
- Your iPhone and iPad are "consumers" - they display everything and sync changes

### **Layer 2: The Cloud (Optional Helper)**
- Provides backup storage (if you want)
- Helps with heavy computing (AI processing)
- Enables device synchronization
- **Critical:** Never sees your unencrypted data

### **Layer 3: AI Services (OpenAI)**
- Reads your messages to understand meaning
- Creates "semantic fingerprints" (embeddings)
- Only sees plaintext temporarily during processing
- Zero data retention (deleted immediately after)

---

## üë§ **The Complete User Journey (Step-by-Step)**

Let me take you through what happens from the moment you install the app to when you're using it daily.

---

### **STEP 1: Installation & Vault Setup** ‚è±Ô∏è *5 minutes*

**What Happens:**
1. You download "Personal Vault" app on your MacBook
2. First launch: "Welcome! Let's create your secure vault"
3. App asks: "Where do you want to store your data?"
   - **Options shown:**
     - üè† Local only (most private, no backup)
     - ‚òÅÔ∏è iCloud (Apple's service, paid by you)
     - üì¶ Amazon S3 (technical users)
     - üîµ Google Drive (15 GB free)

4. You choose **iCloud** (most users pick this)

5. App says: "Create a master passphrase"
   - You type: `MySecurePass2025!@`
   - App checks: ‚úÖ 12+ characters, strong
   - **Behind the scenes:** Your passphrase goes through PBKDF2 (a mathematical blender that runs 600,000 times) to create an uncrackable encryption key
   - This key is stored in your Mac's **Keychain** (Apple's secure vault) protected by your Mac's hardware security chip (Secure Enclave)

6. App shows 12 words: `apple banana orange elephant guitar river mountain ...`
   - These are your **recovery phrase** (like a master key backup)
   - App says: "Write these on paper. Store in a safe place. We can NEVER recover your data without this."
   - You write them down, verify 3 random words to confirm

7. Setup Touch ID/Face ID for quick unlock

**Maps to Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ **Design Principle 1:** User controls storage (you chose iCloud)
- ‚úÖ **Design Principle 2:** Data isolation (only you have the passphrase)
- ‚úÖ **Part 1 Requirement:** Vault initialization

**What You See:** Progress bar: "Vault created ‚úì Ready to connect platforms"

---

### **STEP 2A: Connect WhatsApp** ‚è±Ô∏è *3 minutes*

**What Happens:**
1. You click **"Connect WhatsApp"** button on Mac app

2. A QR code appears on your Mac screen (a square pixelated pattern)

3. App says: "Open WhatsApp on your phone ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Linked Devices ‚Üí Scan QR code"

4. You pick up your phone, open WhatsApp, tap "Link a Device", scan the QR code with your phone camera

5. **Behind the scenes (you don't see this):**
   - Your phone and Mac establish a secure connection using Signal Protocol (same encryption used for WhatsApp messages)
   - They exchange secret keys (like secret handshakes only they know)
   - Mac receives permission to access your WhatsApp messages
   - Session keys stored in Keychain, protected by your Touch ID

6. Mac says: "WhatsApp connected ‚úì Found 12,347 messages. Ready to sync."

**Maps to Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ **Part 1 Requirement:** WhatsApp onboarding via QR code and Signal Protocol
- ‚úÖ **Part 1 Challenge:** Authentication (solved with QR code pairing)
- ‚úÖ **Design Principle 5:** Safe third-party integration (WhatsApp never learns about your vault)

**What You See:** Green checkmark next to WhatsApp icon. Message count displayed.

---

### **STEP 2B: Connect iMessage** ‚è±Ô∏è *2 minutes*

**What Happens:**
1. You click **"Connect iMessage"** button

2. App says: "iMessage requires Full Disk Access permission"
   - Automatically opens: System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Full Disk Access

3. You drag the app icon into the list and check the box (standard macOS permission flow)

4. **Behind the scenes:**
   - iMessage messages are stored in a hidden database on your Mac: `~/Library/Messages/chat.db`
   - This is a SQLite database (like an Excel file but for apps)
   - Only macOS allows access to this (iPhone doesn't allow apps to read it)
   - App now has permission to READ (not modify) this database

5. App tests access: "Reading iMessage database... ‚úì Found 8,521 messages"

6. App sets up real-time monitoring using **FSEvents** (Apple's file change notification system) - like having a camera watching the database file for new messages

**Maps to Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ **Part 1 Requirement:** iMessage access via SQLite database on macOS
- ‚úÖ **Part 1 Challenge:** Platform-specific authentication (Full Disk Access permission)
- ‚úÖ **Architecture Decision:** Mac-primary ingestion (only Mac can access iMessage)

**What You See:** Green checkmark next to iMessage. "Real-time sync active" indicator.

---

### **STEP 2C: Connect Gmail** ‚è±Ô∏è *3 minutes*

**What Happens:**
1. You click **"Connect Gmail"** button

2. App says: "You'll be redirected to Google to log in"

3. Your browser opens showing Google's login page (familiar blue Google logo)

4. You log in with your Gmail credentials: `yourname@gmail.com` / password

5. Google shows permission request:
   - "Personal Vault wants to:"
   - ‚úÖ Read your email messages
   - ‚úÖ Read your calendar events
   - (Note: **NOT** send emails or modify anything)

6. You click **"Allow"**

7. **Behind the scenes:**
   - Google generates an "access token" (a temporary password valid for 1 hour)
   - And a "refresh token" (a long-term password to get new access tokens)
   - These are sent back to your Mac app
   - App stores them encrypted in Keychain
   - App can now connect to Gmail's IMAP server (imap.gmail.com:993) to fetch emails
   - And CalDAV server (calendar.google.com) to fetch calendar events

8. App says: "Connected to Gmail ‚úì Select folders to sync:"
   - ‚òëÔ∏è Inbox (default checked)
   - ‚òê Sent
   - ‚òê Archive
   
9. You keep defaults, click Next

**Maps to Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ **Part 1 Requirement:** IMAP credential-based access
- ‚úÖ **Part 1 Challenge:** Authentication (OAuth 2.0 - industry standard)
- ‚úÖ **Design Principle 5:** Safe third-party integration (Google only gives read permission)

**What You See:** Green checkmark next to Gmail. "Inbox: 2,145 emails" displayed.

---

### **STEP 3: Historical Backlog Processing** ‚è±Ô∏è *30-60 minutes (automatic, background)*

Now comes the magic. Your Mac needs to process all your old messages (10,000+ messages from the past year). This happens automatically while you continue using your Mac.

**What Happens (WhatsApp Example):**

1. **Mac starts fetching in batches:**
   - Requests messages 1-100 from WhatsApp server
   - Gets back: 100 messages with text, timestamps, sender info
   
2. **For each message:**
   ```
   Message: "Hey! Meeting tomorrow at 2pm at Starbucks to discuss Q4 roadmap"
   ```
   
   **Processing steps:**
   
   a) **Encryption** (happens on Mac):
      - Your master key generates a unique encryption key for this message
      - Message encrypted using AES-256-GCM (military-grade encryption)
      - Encrypted blob looks like: `8f3a9b2c7d1e4f... (gibberish)`
   
   b) **Local Storage** (on Mac):
      - Encrypted message saved to local SQLite database
      - Stored with metadata: sender, timestamp, platform
      - Now searchable by date, sender, etc.
   
   c) **Upload to Cloud** (if iCloud selected):
      - Encrypted blob uploaded to iCloud Drive
      - iCloud sees only gibberish, cannot decrypt
   
   d) **Queue for AI Processing:**
      - Message ID sent to SQS queue (Amazon's message queue service)
      - "Hey, process message #12345 for embeddings"

3. **Checkpoint Saved** (every 100 messages):
   ```sql
   UPDATE checkpoints SET 
     last_message_id = '100',
     messages_processed = 100,
     updated_at = NOW()
   WHERE source = 'whatsapp';
   ```
   - Like saving your progress in a video game
   - If Mac crashes/sleeps, resumes from message #101 next time

4. **Progress Display:**
   You see a dashboard on your Mac:
   ```
   üìä Processing History
   
   WhatsApp:  [‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë] 2,345 / 10,000 (23%)
   iMessage:  [‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà] 8,120 / 15,000 (54%)
   Gmail:     [‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë] 450 / 5,000 (9%)
   
   Estimated time: 35 minutes
   [Pause] [Details]
   ```

5. **Your Mac is usable** - this happens in the background. Mac checks:
   - Are you actively using the computer? ‚Üí Slow down processing
   - Is Mac on battery? ‚Üí Reduce speed to save battery
   - Is Mac overheating? ‚Üí Pause processing
   - Is Mac asleep? ‚Üí Pause, resume on wake

**Maps to Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ **Part 1 Requirement:** Data flow (messages ‚Üí encryption ‚Üí storage)
- ‚úÖ **Part 1 Challenge:** Privacy (encryption before leaving device)
- ‚úÖ **Part 1 Challenge:** Reliability (checkpoint/resume on Mac sleep)
- ‚úÖ **Design Principle 3:** Multi-device sync (preparing data for sync)
- ‚úÖ **Design Principle 4:** Privacy-preserving compute (encryption before cloud upload)

---

### **STEP 4: AI Embedding Generation (The Smart Part)** ‚è±Ô∏è *Happens in cloud, automated*

Now your messages need to become "smart" - the system needs to understand meaning, not just keywords. This is where AI comes in.

**What Happens (Simplified Example):**

**Your message:**
```
"Hey! Meeting tomorrow at 2pm at Starbucks to discuss Q4 roadmap"
```

**Step 4.1: Text Preprocessing (on Mac)**

The Mac app uses **spaCy** (an NLP library) to clean and analyze the message:

1. **Tokenization** (split into words):
   ```
   ["Hey", "!", "Meeting", "tomorrow", "at", "2pm", "at", "Starbucks", "to", "discuss", "Q4", "roadmap"]
   ```

2. **Named Entity Recognition** (find important things):
   ```
   - DATE: "tomorrow"
   - TIME: "2pm"
   - ORGANIZATION: "Starbucks"
   - EVENT: "Q4 roadmap"
   ```

3. **Lemmatization** (reduce words to root form):
   ```
   "meeting" ‚Üí "meet"
   "discussed" ‚Üí "discuss"
   ```

4. **Create clean version for AI:**
   ```
   "meet tomorrow 2pm Starbucks discuss Q4 roadmap"
   ```

**Step 4.2: Ephemeral Key Creation (Critical Security Step)**

This is where the "ephemeral key" magic happens:

1. Mac creates a **temporary decryption key** (like a one-time password):
   ```swift
   ephemeralKey = generateRandomKey() // Random 256-bit key
   keyID = "ephemeral-key-abc123"
   expiresAt = now + 5 minutes
   ```

2. Mac encrypts 100 messages with this ephemeral key:
   ```
   Message 1: Encrypt("Meeting tomorrow...") ‚Üí Blob A
   Message 2: Encrypt("Lunch at noon...") ‚Üí Blob B
   ...
   Message 100: Encrypt("Project update...") ‚Üí Blob Z
   ```

3. Mac uploads encrypted blobs to S3:
   ```
   s3://vault-staging/batch-abc123/msg-1.enc
   s3://vault-staging/batch-abc123/msg-2.enc
   ...
   ```

4. Mac sends job to SQS queue:
   ```json
   {
     "keyID": "ephemeral-key-abc123",
     "ephemeralKey": "j8f3K9d2...", // The temporary key
     "expiresAt": "2025-10-05T10:20:00Z", // 5 minutes from now
     "s3Keys": ["msg-1.enc", "msg-2.enc", ..., "msg-100.enc"],
     "userID": "user-uuid"
   }
   ```

**Step 4.3: Lambda Processing (Cloud, Ephemeral)**

AWS Lambda (a cloud computer that runs for seconds then disappears) wakes up:

1. **Lambda reads the SQS message**, gets the ephemeral key

2. **Validates the key hasn't expired:**
   ```python
   if now > expiresAt:
       print("Key expired! Reject job.")
       return  # Key thrown away, job moved to error queue
   ```

3. **Downloads encrypted messages from S3:**
   ```python
   encrypted_msg_1 = s3.download("msg-1.enc")
   encrypted_msg_2 = s3.download("msg-2.enc")
   ```

4. **Decrypts IN MEMORY** (never writes to disk):
   ```python
   plaintext_1 = decrypt(encrypted_msg_1, ephemeralKey)
   # "Meeting tomorrow at 2pm at Starbucks..."
   
   plaintext_2 = decrypt(encrypted_msg_2, ephemeralKey)
   # "Lunch at noon with the team..."
   
   plaintexts = [plaintext_1, plaintext_2, ..., plaintext_100]
   ```

5. **Sends plaintexts to OpenAI API:**
   ```python
   response = openai.embeddings.create(
       model="text-embedding-3-small",
       input=plaintexts  # Batch of 100 messages
   )
   ```

   **What OpenAI does:**
   - Reads: "Meeting tomorrow at 2pm at Starbucks to discuss Q4 roadmap"
   - Converts to a 1536-dimensional vector (a list of 1536 numbers)
   - These numbers capture the *meaning* of the message
   - Example (simplified): `[0.23, -0.15, 0.87, ..., 0.45]`
   
   **Why this matters:**
   - Messages about "meeting" will have similar numbers
   - Even if written differently: "appointment", "catch up", "sync meeting"
   - Even in different languages: "reuni√≥n" (Spanish) has similar numbers to "meeting" (English)

6. **OpenAI returns embeddings:**
   ```python
   embeddings = [
       [0.23, -0.15, ..., 0.45],  # Message 1 vector
       [0.18, -0.22, ..., 0.51],  # Message 2 vector
       ...
   ]
   ```

7. **Lambda re-encrypts embeddings** with your permanent key:
   ```python
   user_key = derive_from_master_key(userID, "embeddings")
   
   encrypted_emb_1 = encrypt(embeddings[0], user_key)
   encrypted_emb_2 = encrypt(embeddings[1], user_key)
   ```

8. **Stores encrypted embeddings in PostgreSQL:**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO message_embeddings (message_id, embedding, user_id)
   VALUES ('msg-1', encrypted_emb_1, 'user-uuid'),
          ('msg-2', encrypted_emb_2, 'user-uuid'),
          ...;
   ```

9. **Cleanup:**
   ```python
   # Delete staging area
   s3.delete("batch-abc123/*")
   
   # Zero out ephemeral key (overwrite memory with zeros)
   ephemeralKey = bytes(32)  # 00000000...
   
   # Lambda terminates ‚Üí all memory cleared by AWS
   ```

**Step 4.4: Fallback (If You Want 100% Privacy)**

If you enable "Privacy Mode" or OpenAI is down:

1. Mac runs **Sentence-BERT** locally (a smaller AI model, 80 MB)
2. Processes message on Mac: "Meeting tomorrow..." ‚Üí `[0.21, -0.18, ..., 0.42]`
3. Takes 50ms per message (vs. 2ms for cloud)
4. Quality: 58% vs 62.3% (4% less accurate, but acceptable)
5. **OpenAI never sees your data** - completely offline

**Maps to Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ **Part 2 Requirement:** Semantic analysis (AI embeddings)
- ‚úÖ **Part 2 Requirement:** AI/ML technologies (OpenAI, Sentence-BERT, NLP)
- ‚úÖ **Part 1 Challenge:** Privacy (ephemeral keys, zero persistence)
- ‚úÖ **Part 1 Challenge:** Transparency (user sees "Processing via OpenAI (encrypted)")
- ‚úÖ **Design Principle 4:** Privacy-preserving compute (ephemeral keys!)
- ‚úÖ **Design Principle 5:** Safe third-party integration (OpenAI, transparent, optional)

---

### **STEP 5: Multi-Device Sync (Your iPhone & iPad Get Everything)** ‚è±Ô∏è *3 seconds per sync*

Now your iPhone and iPad need to show the same data as your Mac.

**What Happens:**

1. **Mac finishes processing a batch** (100 messages stored, encrypted, embedded)

2. **Mac creates a CRDT operation** (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type):
   Think of this like a recipe card that says:
   ```
   Operation #12345:
   - Action: ADD
   - Type: Message
   - ID: msg-whatsapp-6789
   - Content: [encrypted blob]
   - Timestamp: 2025-10-05 10:15:23
   - Source Device: MacBook (device-id-abc)
   ```

3. **Mac publishes to Redis Pub/Sub:**
   ```
   PUBLISH vault-sync-user-uuid {encrypted-operation-12345}
   ```
   - Redis is like a radio tower broadcasting to all your devices
   - Encrypted with your CRDT sync key

4. **iPhone is listening** (app running in background):
   ```
   [iPhone receives notification from Redis]
   "New operation #12345 from MacBook"
   ```

5. **iPhone downloads and merges:**
   - Downloads encrypted operation
   - Decrypts with local key (from Keychain)
   - Applies operation: "Add message msg-whatsapp-6789 to local database"
   - SQLite updated

6. **iPhone shows new message** (3.2 seconds total from Mac ‚Üí iPhone):
   - Notification: "Personal Vault: 100 new messages synced"
   - Open app ‚Üí messages visible

**Conflict Example (Why CRDT Matters):**

Scenario: You're offline on airplane.
- iPhone: You tag message #500 as "Important"
- Mac (at home): You tag message #500 as "Work"

When you land and reconnect:
- Both devices sync operations
- CRDT algorithm: "Both tags are valid, keep both"
- Result: Message #500 has tags: ["Important", "Work"]
- **No conflict dialog, no data loss, automatic merge**

**Maps to Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ **Design Principle 3:** Multi-device synchronization (CRDT)
- ‚úÖ **Part 1 Challenge:** Reliability (automatic conflict resolution)
- ‚úÖ **Architecture diagram component:** Redis Pub/Sub for CRDT sync

---

### **STEP 6: Real-Time Message Arrival (Live Use)** ‚è±Ô∏è *2-5 seconds from message to all devices*

Now you're done with setup. System is running. A new message arrives. Let's see what happens in real-time.

**Scenario: Your friend texts you on iMessage**

**What Happens (Split Second Timeline):**

**T+0.0s: Message arrives**
- Your Mac's Messages app receives: "Don't forget tomorrow's meeting at 10am!"
- macOS writes it to `chat.db` (the iMessage database)

**T+0.5s: Detection**
- Personal Vault app's **FSEvents watcher** detects: "chat.db file changed!"
- Watcher says: "New messages, go fetch them"

**T+1.0s: Ingestion**
- App queries chat.db:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM message 
  WHERE ROWID > last_checkpoint_rowid
  ORDER BY ROWID
  ```
- Gets back: 1 new message (ROWID #98766)
- Content: "Don't forget tomorrow's meeting at 10am!"

**T+1.2s: Local Storage**
- App encrypts message with your key
- Stores in local vault SQLite
- Updates checkpoint: `last_rowid = 98766`

**T+1.3s: Cloud Upload (Parallel)**
- Encrypted blob uploaded to S3
- Job queued to SQS **LIVE QUEUE** (high priority, separate from batch queue)

**T+1.5s: CRDT Sync**
- CRDT operation created: "New message added"
- Published to Redis: `PUBLISH vault-sync ...`

**T+2.0s: iPhone/iPad Notification**
- Your iPhone (in your pocket) receives Redis notification
- Downloads encrypted operation
- Merges into local database
- Shows notification: "Personal Vault: New message"

**T+60s: AI Processing (Asynchronous, Low Priority)**
- Lambda picks up job from LIVE QUEUE
- Processes embedding (same ephemeral key flow as before)
- Stores encrypted embedding in PostgreSQL
- Now message is searchable semantically

**What You Experience:**
- Mac: Instant (message appears in vault immediately)
- iPhone: 2-3 seconds delay (barely noticeable)
- Search: Available within 1 minute

**Maps to Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ **Part 1 Requirement:** Real-time data flow
- ‚úÖ **Design Principle 3:** Multi-device sync (<5s)
- ‚úÖ **Architecture Decision:** Batch vs. realtime separation (separate queues)

---

### **STEP 7: Semantic Search (The Payoff!)** ‚è±Ô∏è *<200ms per search*

Now the magic you've been waiting for. You want to find messages about a topic.

**Scenario: You search "vacation plans"**

**What Happens:**

**Step 7.1: User Input**
- You open Personal Vault app
- Type in search: `vacation plans`
- Hit Enter

**Step 7.2: Embedding Generation (Your Query)**
Mac creates embedding for your search:
```python
query = "vacation plans"
query_embedding = openai.embeddings.create(
    model="text-embedding-3-small",
    input=query
).data[0].embedding

# Result: [0.45, -0.32, ..., 0.78] (1536 numbers)
```

**Step 7.3: Vector Search (Semantic Matching)**

Mac sends query to PostgreSQL:
```sql
SELECT 
  m.id, 
  m.content, 
  m.timestamp, 
  m.platform,
  1 - (e.embedding <=> :query_embedding) AS similarity
FROM messages m
JOIN message_embeddings e ON m.id = e.message_id
ORDER BY e.embedding <=> :query_embedding
LIMIT 10;
```

**What the database does:**
- Uses **HNSW index** (Hierarchical Navigable Small World graph)
- Like a GPS navigation system for vectors
- Finds messages with embeddings closest to your query embedding
- **Matches by meaning, not keywords:**
  - "vacation plans" matches "holiday ideas"
  - "vacation plans" matches "Urlaubspl√§ne" (German)
  - "vacation plans" matches "planning time off"

**Step 7.4: Results Returned (120ms later)**

```
Search Results for "vacation plans":

1. ‚≠ê WhatsApp (Sep 28) - Similarity: 0.92
   "Let's plan our Hawaii trip for December! Thinking 7 days."
   From: Sarah | 3 participants
   
2. ‚≠ê Email (Sep 25) - Similarity: 0.88
   "RE: Holiday Schedule - Requesting Dec 15-22 off for family vacation"
   From: you ‚Üí HR | 2 participants
   
3. ‚≠ê iMessage (Sep 22) - Similarity: 0.85
   "Beach vacation or mountain cabin? Can't decide ü§î"
   From: John | 2 participants

[Show more results...]
```

**Notice:**
- No exact keyword matches needed
- "vacation" in query matches "trip", "holiday", "time off"
- Cross-platform (WhatsApp + Email + iMessage together)
- Ranked by relevance

**Maps to Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ **Part 2 Requirement:** Semantic search capability
- ‚úÖ **Part 2 Requirement:** Vector database (pgvector with HNSW)
- ‚úÖ **Part 2 Requirement:** Cross-platform matching
- ‚úÖ **Design Principle 2:** Data isolation (only your messages searchable)

---

### **STEP 8: Calendar Event Matching (The Ultimate Feature)** ‚è±Ô∏è *<300ms per query*

The killer feature: "Show me all messages related to this meeting."

**Scenario: You have a calendar event tomorrow**

**Your Calendar Event:**
```
Title: "Q4 Planning Meeting"
Time: Oct 5, 2025, 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM
Location: Conference Room B
Participants: john@company.com, jane@company.com, you
Description: "Discuss Q4 roadmap and strategic priorities"
```

**You click: "Find Related Messages"**

**What Happens:**

**Step 8.1: Event Embedding**
System creates embedding for the event:
```python
event_text = "Q4 Planning Meeting Discuss Q4 roadmap strategic priorities Conference Room B"
event_embedding = openai.embeddings.create(
    model="text-embedding-3-small",
    input=event_text
).data[0].embedding
```

**Step 8.2: Hybrid Query (SQL with Filters)**

PostgreSQL runs a smart query:
```sql
SELECT 
  m.id, 
  m.content, 
  m.timestamp, 
  m.participants,
  m.platform,
  1 - (e.embedding <=> :event_embedding) AS semantic_similarity
FROM messages m
JOIN message_embeddings e ON m.id = e.message_id
WHERE 
  -- Filter 1: Time window (¬±7 days from event)
  m.timestamp BETWEEN '2025-09-28' AND '2025-10-12'
  
  -- Filter 2: Participant overlap (anyone in the meeting)
  AND m.participants && ARRAY['john@company.com', 'jane@company.com', 'you@company.com']
  
  -- Filter 3: Platform preference
  AND m.platform IN ('email', 'whatsapp', 'imessage')
  
ORDER BY e.embedding <=> :event_embedding
LIMIT 50;  -- Get top 50 candidates
```

**Step 8.3: Hybrid Re-Ranking (Client-Side)**

Mac re-scores the 50 candidates using a formula:
```python
for each message:
    # Component 1: Semantic similarity (60% weight)
    semantic_score = 0.88  # From database

**What This Means for You:**
- Before meeting: See all prep messages
- No manual searching across apps
- Messages sorted by relevance
- Even if people said "planning session" vs. "meeting" (semantic matching!)

**Maps to Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ **Part 2 Requirement:** Algorithm to find related messages for calendar event
- ‚úÖ **Part 2 Requirement:** Relate based on content, participants, timestamps, metadata
- ‚úÖ **Part 2 Requirement:** Match across platforms
- ‚úÖ **Part 2 Challenge:** Heterogeneous data (different formats unified)
- ‚úÖ **Design Principle (All):** Complete end-to-end functionality

## üîê **Security & Privacy Guarantees (How It All Stays Safe)**

Let me explain the layers of protection in simple terms:

### **Layer 1: On Your Devices**
- Every message encrypted with AES-256-GCM before leaving your device
- Encryption key in Keychain, protected by Secure Enclave (hardware chip, can't be extracted)
- Even if someone steals your Mac, they can't decrypt without your passphrase + Touch ID

### **Layer 2: In Transit (Network)**
- All data sent over TLS 1.3 (like HTTPS, secure tunnel)
- Even if someone intercepts network traffic, sees only encrypted gibberish

### **Layer 3: In Cloud Storage**
- iCloud/S3 sees only encrypted blobs
- Cannot decrypt without your master key (which never leaves your devices)
- Double encryption: Your encryption + iCloud's encryption

### **Layer 4: During AI Processing**
- Ephemeral keys exist for maximum 5 minutes
- Never persisted on server disks
- Lambda logs disabled for sensitive operations
- OpenAI sees plaintext (necessary for embeddings) but zero retention policy
- After processing: Memory cleared, staging area deleted

**Zero-Knowledge Architecture:**
- We (the developers) cannot read your data
- Cloud providers (AWS, iCloud) cannot read your data
- Only OpenAI sees plaintext temporarily during embedding generation
- You can switch to 100% local mode (no cloud AI) anytime

## üö® **What If Scenarios (Reliability)**

### **What if my Mac crashes during backlog processing?**
‚úÖ **Checkpoint saved every 100 messages**
- Mac restarts, app opens
- Loads checkpoint: "Processed 4,300 of 10,000 WhatsApp messages"
- Resumes from message #4,301
- Zero data loss, zero reprocessing

### **What if my Mac is offline for a week?**
‚úÖ **Automatic catch-up on reconnection**
- Mac reconnects to internet
- Detects gap: "Last iMessage sync: 7 days ago"
- Queries: "SELECT * FROM messages WHERE date > last_sync_date"
- Processes accumulated messages (typically <1,000 for a week)
- Takes 5-10 minutes to catch up

### **What if Mac is offline and I need WhatsApp?**
‚úÖ **iPhone fallback after 24 hours**
- iPhone detects: "Mac hasn't synced in 24 hours"
- Prompts: "Continue WhatsApp sync on iPhone?"
- You approve, scan QR code on iPhone
- iPhone takes over WhatsApp ingestion
- Mac returns ‚Üí Requests handoff, iPhone stops

### **What if I edit the same message on iPhone and Mac offline?**
‚úÖ **CRDT automatic merge**
- iPhone: Add tag "Work"
- Mac: Add tag "Important"
- Both reconnect
- CRDT merges: Message has both tags ["Work", "Important"]
- No conflict dialog, no data loss

### **What if OpenAI API is down?**
‚úÖ **Automatic fallback to local embeddings**
- Lambda can't reach OpenAI
- Job moved to "retry queue"
- After 3 failures ‚Üí Mac notified
- Mac switches to local Sentence-BERT
- Processes embeddings on-device (slower but works)
