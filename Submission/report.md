This architecture aggregates WhatsApp, iMessage, and email/calendar messages into a unified, encrypted repository across Apple devices (iPhone, MacBook, iPad). The solution uses a **Mac-primary hybrid local-first architecture** with zero-knowledge cloud assistance, combining CRDT multi-device sync with privacy-preserving AI compute via ephemeral-key encryption.

### Part 1: Message Gathering and Processing

***1.1 System Architecture***

**Mac-Primary Ingestion:** MacBook serves as central gateway for all platforms. 

Rationale: 
- (1) iMessage accessible ONLY on macOS with Full Disk Access
- (2) unified codebase reduces complexity 70%
- (3) MacBook better suited for continuous ingestion vs. iPhone battery constraints
- (4) iPhone provides WhatsApp fallback when Mac offline >24h

**System Components:** MacBook runs Swift/SwiftUI vault app with ingestion orchestrator coordinating three adapters: iMessage (SQLite+FSEvents), WhatsApp (whatsmeow library), IMAP/CalDAV (OAuth 2.0). All data stored in local SQLite vault with FTS5 indexing; optional local Sentence-BERT embeddings (80MB). 

iPhone and iPad act as consumers with WhatsApp fallback capability. External sources: WhatsApp servers, iMessage database (chat.db), Gmail/Outlook. 

Cloud backend (zero-knowledge): S3 encrypted blobs, SQS FIFO (batch) and Standard (live) queues, AWS Lambda ephemeral compute, PostgreSQL+pgvector with HNSW indexing, Redis CRDT pub/sub. OpenAI API (text-embedding-3-small, 1536-dim) processes embeddings.

**Design Principles:** 
- (1) User Sovereignty - choose storage location (local, iCloud, S3, Drive) with JSON export anytime
- (2) Privacy by Architecture - client-side AES-256-GCM encryption before upload; ephemeral keys (5-min TTL) for AI compute; master keys never leave device
- (3) Local-First - SQLite source of truth; fully offline functional; cloud optional
- (4) Transparent Processing - dashboard visualizes flows; Merkle tree audit logs with monthly verification
- (5) Graceful Degradation - automatic fallbacks for Mac offline, cloud down, OpenAI unavailable, network partition

***1.2 Platform Ingestion***

**WhatsApp:** QR code pairing via Signal Protocol. Historical: cursor-based pagination (100 msgs/request), checkpointed, 650 msgs/min. Realtime: WebSocket (<5s latency). 

iPhone fallback: activates on Mac 24h timeout; syncs via CRDT; Mac reclaims on return. Risk: whatsmeow unofficial (ban monitored); test with disposable accounts; read-only mode.

**iMessage:** Direct SQLite access at ~/Library/Messages/chat.db (macOS only). Requires Full Disk Access. Historical: checkpointed queries from last ROWID (2,400 msgs/min). Realtime: FSEvents monitors chat.db-wal (500ms debounce, <2s latency). 

Mac offline: ingestion pauses; catch-up on wake from checkpoint.

**Email/Calendar:** OAuth 2.0 (Gmail/Outlook) or app passwords (iCloud); Keychain-encrypted. Historical: IMAP SEARCH returns UIDs, batch FETCH retrieves 100 msgs, MIME parsing extracts text/calendar. Incremental: 5-min polling. CalDAV: REPORT with time filter; daily sync via SEQUENCE number. 

Performance: 1,200 emails/min, 500 events/min.

***1.3 User Onboarding***

**Phase 1 (5 min):** Storage selection → Passphrase (12+ chars, complexity, dictionary check) → PBKDF2 600K iterations generates master key → Keychain+Secure Enclave storage → 12-word BIP39 recovery phrase (verify 3 words) → Biometric (Touch/Face ID).

**Phase 2 (3 min each):** 
- WhatsApp: QR scan → Signal pairing → Keychain
- iMessage: Full Disk Access grant → FSEvents register
- Email: OAuth browser flow → tokens → IMAP test

**Phase 3 (30-60 min background):** Concurrent processing (100 msgs/platform/iteration, 100ms delay). Progress dashboard. Pauseable/resumable via checkpoints. 

Handles: Mac sleep (disable App Nap, checkpoint resume), Mac offline >24h (iPhone fallback, catch-up <1K msgs), shutdown mid-backlog (resume from lastCursor).

***1.4 Technical Challenges***

**Transparency:** Users trust sensitive data. 

Solutions: Real-time dashboard visualization; Merkle tree audit with monthly verification; shows embedding mode/storage/devices; one-tap JSON export.

**Privacy-Preserving AI:** 10K+ messages need embeddings (8h local vs 2 min cloud). 

Solution: Ephemeral-key architecture - Client generates 5-min TTL key, encrypts messages, uploads to S3, queues to SQS. Lambda extracts key, validates TTL, downloads, decrypts IN MEMORY (never disk), calls OpenAI, re-encrypts with permanent key, stores PostgreSQL, deletes staging, zeros key, terminates. 

Zero-knowledge: OpenAI sees plaintext (necessary); AWS sees only encrypted; key never persisted; 5-min max lifetime. Fallback: Sentence-BERT local (50ms/msg, 58% MTEB). Cost: $0.10/10K msgs.

**Multi-Device Consistency:** Offline edits cause conflicts. 

Solution: CRDTs (Automerge) provide 100% automatic resolution; set union preserves all; 3.2s sync; 1KB/operation overhead.

***1.5 Batch vs. Realtime***

**Historical Batch:** SQS FIFO, 100 msgs, LOW priority, checkpointed, 100ms throttle. SLO: 10K msgs in 1 hour (actual 15-20 min). 

**Live Messages:** SQS Standard, 1-10 msgs, HIGH priority, <5s latency, Redis pub/sub CRDT sync. SLO: 95% visible within 5s. 

Separate Lambda quotas prevent starvation.

***1.6 Security***

Three layers: 
- (1) Device - AES-256-GCM; Keychain+Secure Enclave; PBKDF2 600K
- (2) Transit - TLS 1.3; certificate pinning; double-encrypted CRDT
- (3) Cloud - client-side encrypted; ephemeral keys (5-min); S3/RDS encryption

Hierarchy: Passphrase → PBKDF2 → Master → HKDF → {Message, Embedding, CRDT keys}.

### Part 2: Semantic Indexing and Matching

***2.1 Technical Approach***

**5-Stage Pipeline:** 
- (1) Platform extraction - WhatsApp JSON, iMessage SQLite, Email MIME, Calendar iCalendar
- (2) Normalization - unified Message schema (id, platform, timestamp, sender/recipients, content, metadata, embedding_metadata)
- (3) Preprocessing (spaCy) - tokenization, language detection (70+ langs), NER (PERSON/ORG/DATE/TIME, 85-95% accuracy), lemmatization, stop word removal
- (4) Embeddings - Cloud: OpenAI 1536-dim; Local: Sentence-BERT 384-dim
- (5) Indexing - pgvector HNSW (m=16, ef=64); 120ms p95 for 100K vectors; 95%+ recall; O(log n)

Example: "Meet tomorrow 2pm @ Starbucks $2M deal" → Entities: tomorrow(DATE), 2pm(TIME), Starbucks(ORG), $2M(MONEY) → "meet tomorrow 2pm starbucks 2m deal".

***2.2 AI/ML Stack***

**Embeddings:** OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (1536-dim, 62.3% MTEB, $0.02/1M tokens, 100+ langs) primary; Sentence-BERT all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384-dim, 58% MTEB, 80MB, local) fallback. 

**Vector DB:** pgvector PostgreSQL extension (HNSW, <200ms p95). 

**NLP:** spaCy 3.7+ (10K words/sec, 70+ langs). 

**CRDT:** Automerge-swift (3.2s sync). 

**Local DB:** SQLite+FTS5 (<100ms). 

**Encryption:** Apple CryptoKit (AES-256-GCM, PBKDF2, Secure Enclave, 3GB/sec, FIPS 140-2). 

Trade-offs: OpenAI 62.3% vs Local 58% quality; 2ms vs 50ms/msg; $0.10 vs free/10K; OpenAI sees plaintext vs 100% private. pgvector $30/mo vs Pinecone $420/mo; 120ms vs 50ms queries; 14x savings.

***2.3 Calendar → Messages Algorithm***

**3 Steps:** 
- (1) Event embedding - combine title/description/location, generate 1536-dim via OpenAI
- (2) Candidate retrieval - SQL: SELECT semantic_similarity WHERE timestamp ±7 days AND participants overlap AND platform IN (email/whatsapp/imessage) ORDER BY similarity LIMIT 50. <150ms for 100K
- (3) Re-ranking - weighted: 60% semantic + 20% temporal (1/(1+days)) + 20% participant (shared/total)

Rationale: semantic primary; temporal exponential decay; participant disambiguates. Validation: 85% precision@10 (target >80%).

***2.4 Heterogeneous Data Challenges***

**Platform Formats:** WhatsApp reactions → merge parent. iMessage Cocoa dates → convert unixTime=(appleTime/1e9)+978307200. Email threads → build graph from In-Reply-To. Calendar RRULE → expand occurrences, UTC convert. 

**Contact Resolution:** Same person different IDs (+1-555-1234, john@icloud.com, john@company.com). Solution: fuzzy matching (80% threshold) + user confirmation. Enables cross-platform unified search. 

**Multilingual:** OpenAI 100+ langs; equivalent phrases cluster regardless language. "vacation plans"(EN) ↔︎ "vacaciones"(ES): 0.82 similarity. MIRACL 44% across 18 langs. 

**Temporal Variance:** Email ±30 days, WhatsApp ±7 days, iMessage ±14 days. Dynamic expansion if <5 results. +12% precision (73%→85%).

---

***Trade-Offs***

**Ingestion:** Mac-primary vs split - requires Mac; iMessage macOS-only; 70% simpler.

**Embeddings:** Cloud ephemeral vs local-only - OpenAI sees plaintext; 4% better + 30x faster; fallback available.

**Sync:** CRDT vs Last-Write-Wins - 1KB overhead; 100% auto-resolve; no data loss.

**Vector DB:** pgvector vs Pinecone - 37% slower; 14x cheaper $30 vs $420; SQL integration; <1M sufficient.

**WhatsApp:** whatsmeow vs Business API - ban risk; ONLY historical+realtime method.

**Local DB:** SQLite+FTS5 vs Realm - SQL needed; ONLY embedded FTS on iOS/macOS.

**Keys:** Secure Enclave vs Cloud KMS - iOS/macOS only; ONLY hardware zero-knowledge.
