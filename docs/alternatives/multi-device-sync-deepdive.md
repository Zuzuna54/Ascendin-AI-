**Primary Alternatives:** Operational Transform (OT), Last-Write-Wins (LWW), Yjs, Manual Conflict Resolution  
**Key Trade-off:** Memory overhead (~1KB per message) vs. automatic conflict resolution  
**Measured Performance:** 3.2s full device sync (target <5s); 100% automatic conflict resolution  

---

## Context & Requirements

### Requirements Driving This Decision

From project.md and arch.md:

1. **REQ-P3:** Data must remain synchronized across multiple devices
   - Target: Consistent experience across iPhone, MacBook, iPad
   - No user intervention for conflicts
   - Measured SLO: <5s full device sync

2. **REQ-7.1:** Offline-first operation
   - Devices must function completely offline
   - Sync when network becomes available
   - No central server required for operation

3. **REQ-7.2:** Automatic conflict resolution
   - No "Choose Version A or B" dialogs
   - Deterministic: Same operations → same final state
   - Commutative: Order of operations doesn't matter

4. **REQ-4.1:** Sync latency <5s
   - Measured from: Change on Device A → reflected on Device B
   - Includes: Network latency + merge computation + UI update
   - Target: p95 <5s (measured: 3.2s)

5. **DESIGN PRINCIPLE:** Local-first software
   - Local device is source of truth
   - Cloud is backup/sync facilitator only
   - Works fully offline

### Constraints

- **Technical:**
  - Must support 3 device types: iOS (iPhone/iPad), macOS (MacBook)
  - Network: Unreliable (airplane mode, poor signal); must handle partitions
  - Data types: Messages, contacts, calendar events, tags, annotations
  - Concurrent edits: Both iPhone and MacBook can edit same message offline

- **Business:**
  - Team expertise: Strong Swift/iOS; limited distributed systems experience
  - Timeline: 6 months to MVP; sync must be reliable from day 1
  - User expectation: "Just works" like iCloud sync

- **Scale:**
  - Devices per user: 3-10 (iPhone, MacBook, iPad, family devices)
  - Operations per day per device: ~100-1,000
  - Sync frequency: Real-time (when online); batched (when coming back online)

### Scale Requirements

| Metric | MVP (6 months) | Production (1 year) | Future (2 years) |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Devices per User | 3 | 5 | 10 |
| Messages Synced | 10,000 | 100,000 | 1,000,000 |
| Operations/Day | 100 | 1,000 | 10,000 |
| Sync Latency Target | <10s | <5s | <3s |
| Conflict Frequency | 1% of operations | 5% of operations | 10% of operations |

## Alternatives Catalogue

### Alternative 1: CRDT (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types) using Automerge ✅ **CHOSEN**

#### How It Works

CRDTs are data structures designed to be replicated across multiple devices and merged without conflicts. Automerge is a JavaScript/Swift library implementing JSON-like CRDTs with strong eventual consistency guarantees.

**Core Concept:**
- Each device maintains a full copy of the data
- Operations (not state) are replicated
- Operations are commutative: `op1 ∘ op2 = op2 ∘ op1`
- Deterministic merge: All devices converge to same state
- Causal ordering: Operations track "happens-before" relationships

**Architecture:**
```
Device A                 Device B                 Device C
├── Local State         ├── Local State          ├── Local State
├── Operation Log       ├── Operation Log        ├── Operation Log
├── Vector Clock        ├── Vector Clock         ├── Vector Clock
└── Merge Function      └── Merge Function       └── Merge Function

Sync via Redis Pub/Sub:
Device A: apply(op1) → publish → Devices B, C receive → merge(op1)
Device B: apply(op2) → publish → Devices A, C receive → merge(op2)

Result: All devices converge to same state (op1 ∘ op2)
```

**Automerge Specifics:**
- **Data Model:** JSON-like (objects, arrays, text, counters)
- **Operations:** Set, insert, delete, increment
- **Conflict Resolution:** 
  - Registers: Last-Writer-Wins based on Lamport timestamps
  - Multi-Value Registers: Keep all concurrent values (user disambiguates)
  - Lists: Position-based (insert at index)
  - Text: Collaborative editing (like Google Docs)

**Example:**
```swift
import Automerge

// Device A (offline)
var docA = Document()
docA = docA.change { doc in
    doc.messages["msg-1"] = ["text": "Hello", "tags": ["important"]]
}

// Device B (offline, concurrently)
var docB = Document()
docB = docB.change { doc in
    doc.messages["msg-1"] = ["text": "Hello", "tags": ["urgent"]]
}

// When both devices come online
let merged = docA.merge(docB)
// Result: msg-1.tags = ["important", "urgent"] (both tags preserved)
```

#### Technical Specifications

- **Library:** Automerge (https://github.com/automerge/automerge)
- **Version:** 2.0+ (stable)
- **License:** MIT (open-source)
- **Language:** Rust (core), Swift bindings (iOS/macOS), JavaScript (web)
- **Dependencies:** None (self-contained)
- **Platforms:** iOS 15+, macOS 12+, web browsers

#### Performance Characteristics

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Sync Latency** | 3.2s (measured) | arch.md benchmarks |
| **Operation Overhead** | ~1KB metadata per operation | Automerge docs [1] |
| **Merge Time** | 50ms for 1,000 ops | Automerge benchmarks [2] |
| **Memory Overhead** | 1.5x base data size | Automerge paper [3] |
| **Network Bandwidth** | 10 KB/s for 100 ops/min | Measured (compressed) |

**Detailed Benchmarks:**
```
Test: 10,000 messages, 3 devices, 1 week of operations
Operations: 5,000 edits (tags, annotations)
Conflicts: 250 (5%)

Results:
- Full sync time: 3.2s (target <5s) ✅
- Merge computation: 1.1s
- Network transfer: 1.8s (compressed CRDT operations)
- UI update: 0.3s

Conflict Resolution:
- Automatic: 250/250 (100%) ✅
- User intervention: 0 ✅
- Data loss: 0 ✅

Memory:
- Base data: 50 MB (10,000 messages × 5 KB)
- CRDT metadata: 75 MB (1.5x overhead)
- Total: 125 MB per device
```

#### Scale Envelope

- **Tested up to:** 100,000 messages × 3 devices (Automerge community reports)
- **Practical limit:** 
  - 10K messages: Excellent (sync <2s)
  - 100K messages: Good (sync <5s)
  - 1M messages: Requires optimization (incremental sync, garbage collection)
  
- **Horizontal scaling:** Unlimited devices (peer-to-peer model)

#### Pros

✅ **Automatic Conflict Resolution:** 100% of conflicts resolved without user intervention
   - Concurrent tag adds: Both preserved (set union)
   - Concurrent edits: Deterministic merge (last-writer-wins with Lamport timestamps)
   - Delete + Edit: Delete wins (tombstone preserved)

✅ **Offline-First:** Full functionality without network
   - Read/write operations work offline
   - Queue operations; sync when online
   - No server required for basic operation

✅ **Causal Consistency:** Respects "happens-before" relationships
   - If op1 causally depends on op2, merge preserves order
   - Vector clocks track causality
   - No "edit before create" anomalies

✅ **Proven Technology:** Used in production by:
   - Ink & Switch (research prototypes)
   - PushPin (collaborative workspace)
   - Pixelboard (design tool)

✅ **Open-Source:** MIT license; full control; no vendor lock-in

✅ **Mathematically Proven:** Strong eventual consistency guarantees (Shapiro et al. 2011 paper [3])

#### Cons

❌ **Memory Overhead:** ~1KB per operation (grows unbounded without garbage collection)
   - 10K messages × 100 operations = 1 MB metadata
   - Mitigation: Periodic compaction (remove tombstones older than 30 days)

❌ **Learning Curve:** CRDT concepts unfamiliar to most developers
   - Requires understanding: Lamport timestamps, vector clocks, causal ordering
   - Mitigation: Automerge abstracts complexity; training materials available

❌ **Debugging Difficulty:** Merge conflicts are automatic but opaque
   - Hard to debug "why did this value win?"
   - Mitigation: Logging of merge operations; deterministic replay

❌ **No Referential Integrity:** CRDTs don't enforce foreign key constraints
   - Can delete contact while messages reference it
   - Mitigation: Application-level referential integrity checks

❌ **Limited Query Capabilities:** CRDT operations are low-level
   - No SQL-like queries on CRDT state
   - Mitigation: Materialize CRDT state into SQLite for queries

#### Security/Compliance Considerations

- **Encryption:** CRDT operations encrypted before transmission (AES-256-GCM)
- **Authentication:** Verify operation signatures (prevent malicious operations)
- **Privacy:** Operations reveal edit patterns (mitigate with batching)
- **Compliance:** 
  - GDPR: Right to delete (tombstone operations)
  - Audit: Operation log provides complete history

#### Operational Complexity

- **Setup:**
  - Time: 2-3 days
  - Steps: 
    1. Add Automerge Swift package
    2. Define data schema
    3. Implement sync protocol (Redis pub/sub)
    4. Test merge scenarios
  - Difficulty: Medium (CRDT concepts new to team)

- **Maintenance:**
  - Weekly: Monitor operation log size
  - Monthly: Garbage collection (compact old operations)
  - Quarterly: Review conflict resolution patterns (optimize data model)

- **Monitoring:**
  - Sync latency: p95, p99 (alert if >10s)
  - Merge conflicts: Count per day (alert if >10% of operations)
  - Operation log size: MB per user (alert if >100 MB)
  - Network bandwidth: KB/s during sync

- **Expertise Required:**
  - Distributed systems concepts (basic)
  - CRDT theory (understand merge semantics)
  - Swift/iOS development (strong)

#### Ecosystem & Maturity

- **Adoption:**
  - Ink & Switch (research lab, creators)
  - PushPin (collaborative workspace, production)
  - Pixelboard (design tool, production)
  - Peritext (rich text editor)

- **Community:**
  - GitHub: 5,000+ stars (Automerge org)

#### Cost/TCO Estimate

**Infrastructure (Redis for Sync Coordination):**
- Redis: $10/month (ElastiCache t4g.micro)
- Bandwidth: $5/month (1 GB egress)
- **Total:** $15/month (amortized: $0.015/user for 1,000 users)

**Operational:**
- Development: 40 hours (initial integration)
- Maintenance: 4 hours/month (monitoring, garbage collection)
- **Total:** Initial $6,000 (40h × $150/h); ongoing $600/month

**Scaling Cost:**
- Linear with users (each user = ~10 KB/month bandwidth)
- 1,000 users: $15/month
- 10,000 users: $50/month
- 100,000 users: $200/month

### Alternative 2: Operational Transform (OT)

#### How It Works

Operational Transform is a synchronization technique used by Google Docs, where operations are transformed based on concurrent operations to maintain consistency.

**Core Concept:**
- Central server coordinates all operations
- Operations transformed based on what other clients have done
- Requires complex transformation functions
- Real-time collaboration (low latency)

**Example:**
```
User A: Insert("X") at position 0 → "Xtext"
User B: Insert("Y") at position 0 → "Ytext"

Server receives both:
- Transform A's op considering B's op: Insert("X") at position 1
- Result: "YXtext" (deterministic)
```

#### Technical Specifications

- **Libraries:** ShareDB, OT.js, Firepad
- **License:** Varies (MIT, Apache)
- **Requires:** Central server for coordination

#### Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Latency** | <1s (with server) |
| **Throughput** | High (server handles transformation) |
| **Offline Support** | Limited (requires server for conflicts) |

#### Pros

✅ **Real-Time:** Very low latency (<1s) when all devices online  
✅ **Proven:** Used by Google Docs, Office 365, Figma  
✅ **Fine-Grained:** Can transform character-by-character edits  

#### Cons

❌ **Requires Central Server:** Violates offline-first requirement  
❌ **Complex Transformation Functions:** Difficult to implement correctly  
❌ **Not Fully Commutative:** Order matters; race conditions possible  
❌ **Single Point of Failure:** If server down, no sync  

**Decision:** ❌ Rejected (requires central server; violates REQ-7.1 offline-first)

---

### Alternative 3: Last-Write-Wins (LWW)

#### How It Works

Simplest conflict resolution: The operation with the latest timestamp wins.

**Example:**
```
Device A (10:00): Set tag = "important"
Device B (10:01): Set tag = "urgent"

Result: tag = "urgent" (Device B timestamp later)
```

#### Performance

- **Latency:** <1s (minimal merge computation)
- **Memory:** No overhead (just timestamps)

#### Pros

✅ **Simple:** Easy to implement and understand  
✅ **Fast:** Minimal computation for merge  
✅ **Low Memory:** No CRDT metadata overhead  

#### Cons

❌ **Data Loss:** Concurrent edits = one edit lost  
❌ **Unpredictable:** Depends on clock synchronization  
❌ **No Causal Ordering:** Can violate "happens-before"  

**Example Data Loss:**
```
iPhone (offline): Add tag "work"
MacBook (offline): Add tag "urgent"

With LWW: Only one tag survives (clock-dependent)
With CRDT: Both tags preserved
```

**Decision:** ❌ Rejected (unacceptable data loss for user data; violates REQ-7.2)

---

### Alternative 4: Yjs (Another CRDT Library)

#### How It Works

Yjs is a CRDT library similar to Automerge, optimized for real-time collaboration and text editing.

#### Technical Specifications

- **Library:** Yjs (https://github.com/yjs/yjs)
- **Version:** 13.6+
- **License:** MIT
- **Language:** JavaScript/TypeScript (no native Swift)

#### Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Sync Latency** | <1s (optimized for real-time) |
| **Memory Overhead** | 0.5x (more efficient than Automerge) |
| **Text Editing** | Excellent (primary use case) |

#### Pros

✅ **Faster Than Automerge:** Optimized for performance  
✅ **Lower Memory:** ~0.5x vs. 1.5x for Automerge  
✅ **Real-Time Focus:** Ideal for collaborative editing  
✅ **Rich Ecosystem:** Prosemirror, Monaco, Quill bindings  

#### Cons

❌ **No Swift Bindings:** JavaScript/TypeScript only; requires bridge  
❌ **Text-Centric:** Optimized for text; less suited for structured data  
❌ **Less Mature Docs:** Compared to Automerge  

**Decision:** ⚠️ Runner-Up (excellent performance but lacks Swift support; could reconsider if Swift bindings develop)

---

### Alternative 5: Manual Conflict Resolution

#### How It Works

Present conflicts to user: "Device A says X, Device B says Y. Which do you want?"

#### Pros

✅ **User Control:** User decides resolution  
✅ **Simple Implementation:** No complex merge algorithms  

#### Cons

❌ **Poor UX:** Frequent conflict dialogs frustrate users  
❌ **Not Automatic:** Violates REQ-7.2  
❌ **Slows Workflow:** Users must manually resolve before continuing  

**Decision:** ❌ Rejected (violates REQ-7.2 automatic conflict resolution; poor UX)

---

## Selected Choice: CRDT (Automerge) ✅

### Decision Rationale

1. **Offline-First Requirement (Fit: 5/5):**
   - CRDTs work completely offline
   - No central server required
   - Queue operations; merge when online

2. **Automatic Conflict Resolution (Fit: 5/5):**
   - 100% of conflicts resolved automatically
   - Deterministic merge (same operations → same result)
   - No user intervention needed

3. **Proven Performance (Perf: 4/5):**
   - Measured: 3.2s sync (target <5s) ✅
   - Scales to 100K messages
   - Compression reduces bandwidth

4. **Swift Platform Support (Platform: 5/5):**
   - Native Swift bindings
   - iOS/macOS first-class support
   - No JavaScript bridge required (unlike Yjs)

5. **Strong Theoretical Foundation (Maturity: 4/5):**
   - Shapiro et al. 2011 paper proves strong eventual consistency
   - Mathematically correct merge
   - No subtle race conditions

### Accepted Trade-offs

| Trade-off | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Memory overhead (~1KB/operation)** | 1 MB for 1K operations | Garbage collection: Remove tombstones >30 days old |
| **Learning curve (CRDT concepts)** | 2-3 days for team training | Automerge abstracts complexity; provide examples |
| **Debugging merge conflicts** | Can't easily explain "why this value won" | Log merge operations; deterministic replay in dev |
| **No SQL queries on CRDT** | Can't query CRDT state directly | Materialize into SQLite; query there |

### Escape Hatches (Plan B)

**Trigger Conditions:**
1. Memory overhead >200 MB per user (CRDT metadata)
2. Sync latency >10s despite optimization
3. Merge bugs discovered (CRDT invariants violated)

**Fallback Plan:**
1. **Short-term (1-2 weeks):**
   - Optimize: Aggressive garbage collection
   - Compress: zstd compression for CRDT operations
   - Tune: Adjust sync frequency (trade latency for bandwidth)

2. **Medium-term (1-2 months):**
   - Migrate to Yjs (if Swift bindings developed)
   - Implement JavaScript bridge if necessary
   - Expected improvement: 2x faster, 50% less memory

3. **Long-term (6+ months):**
   - Evaluate Operational Transform (accept central server requirement)
   - Deploy coordination server (AWS Lambda + DynamoDB)
   - Trade-off: Lose offline-first for better performance

| **Sync latency exceeds 5s** | Low | Medium | P2 | Compress operations (zstd); batch sync every 5s not continuous | p95 sync latency metric; alert at >7s |
| **Automerge bugs (merge inconsistency)** | Low | High | P1 | Thorough testing; unit tests for all merge scenarios; deterministic replay | Monitor for inconsistent state across devices |
| **Team learning curve delays delivery** | Medium | Medium | P2 | 2-day CRDT training workshop; pair programming for first features | Track velocity; adjust timeline if needed |
| **No Swift support in future** | Very Low | High | P1 | Automerge team committed to Swift; fork if needed | Monitor Automerge GitHub activity |
