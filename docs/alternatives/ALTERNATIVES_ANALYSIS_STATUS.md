9. Message Queue (async processing)
10. Key Storage (security)

**Priority 3 (P2 - Medium):**
11-22. Remaining decisions (important but less architec

turally pivotal)

### Systematic Approach

For each decision, following exact framework template:

**1. Context & Requirements (300-400 lines)**
- Requirements from project.md
- Technical/business/legal constraints
- Scale requirements with metrics

**2. Alternatives Catalogue (800-1,200 lines)**
- 3-6 alternatives researched
- Each with: How it works, specs, performance, pros/cons, security, ops complexity, ecosystem, cost
- Official citations for every claim

**3. Weighted Comparison Matrix (200-300 lines)**
- 5 criteria with justification for weights
- Scoring 1-5 scale with detailed rationale
- Winner must match arch.md

**4. Selected Choice Justification (200-300 lines)**
- Decision rationale (3-5 paragraphs)
- Accepted trade-offs table
- Escape hatches (Plan B)
- Validation completed/pending

**5. Risk Assessment (200-300 lines)**
- Risks with likelihood/impact/severity
- Specific mitigations
- Contingency plans

**6. Validation Plan (300-400 lines)**
- 2-3 proposed spikes/benchmarks
- Success criteria (quantitative)
- Resources and timeline
- Decision points
