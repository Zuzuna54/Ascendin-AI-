# Alternatives Analysis - Index

## Purpose

This comprehensive alternatives analysis examines every major architectural decision in the Personal Data Vault, exploring 3-6 viable alternatives for each choice, with deep technical research, performance data, cost analysis, and risk assessment.

**Methodology:** Each decision is analyzed using:
- Requirements mapping (from project.md)
- Technical deep-dive on alternatives (how they work)
- Weighted comparison matrix (scored criteria)
- Architecture Decision Record (ADR format)
- Validation plan (spikes/benchmarks)
- Source-backed citations with verification dates

## Comparison Methodology

Each decision area document includes:

### 1. Context & Requirements
- Which requirements drive this decision
- Constraints and assumptions
- Scale requirements (users, data volume, latency)

### 2. Alternatives Catalogue (3-6 options)
For each alternative:
- **How It Works:** 1-3 paragraphs explaining the technology
- **Pros/Cons Table**
- **Performance Envelope:** Latency, throughput, scale limits
- **Security/Compliance:** Relevant considerations
- **Operational Complexity:** Setup, maintenance, expertise needed
- **Ecosystem Maturity:** Adoption, community, last updated
- **Cost/TCO:** Pricing model, estimates
- **Citations:** Official docs, benchmarks, whitepapers (URLs + dates)

### 3. Weighted Comparison Matrix
Criteria typically include:
- Fit to requirements (30%)
- Performance/scalability (20%)
- Operational complexity (20%)
- Cost/TCO (15%)
- Delivery speed (15%)

### 4. Selected Choice & Rationale
- Winner from matrix (must match arch.md)
- Detailed justification
- Accepted trade-offs
- Escape hatches (plan B if choice fails)

### 5. Risk Assessment
- Key risks with chosen option
- Likelihood × Impact
- Mitigations
- Monitoring/telemetry to watch

### 6. Validation Plan
- Proposed spikes or benchmarks
- Success criteria
- Sample datasets/tools
- Timeline estimates
