---

## Context & Requirements

### Requirements Driving This Decision

From project.md and arch.md:

1. **REQ-2.1:** Index messages by content for semantic search
   - Must support cosine similarity search on 1536-d vectors (OpenAI embeddings)
   - Target: <200ms p95 query latency for 10K-100K messages
   
2. **REQ-2.3:** Calendar event → related messages algorithm
   - Must combine semantic similarity with metadata filtering (temporal, participants)
   - Hybrid ranking: 60% semantic + 20% temporal + 20% participant overlap

3. **REQ-4.4:** Search performance <200ms
   - Measured metric: p95 latency for ANN search
   - Scale: 10K messages (MVP) → 100K messages (production) → 1M messages (future)

4. **REQ-5.1:** End-to-end encryption
   - Vectors must be stored encrypted
   - Decryption happens client-side only

5. **CONSTRAINT-C2:** Cost target $2/user/month

├── HNSW Index (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)
├── IVFFlat Index (Inverted File with Flat quantization)
└── Standard SQL Operators (<->, <=>, <#>)
```

**Key Features:**
- Native PostgreSQL data type: `vector(n)` where n = dimensions
- Distance operators: `<->` (L2), `<=>` (cosine), `<#>` (inner product)
- Indexing: HNSW (exact), IVFFlat (approximate)
- SQL-native: Use WHERE clauses for metadata filtering
- ACID transactions: Full PostgreSQL guarantees

#### Technical Specifications

- **Version:** 0.5.4 (as of Oct 2024)
- **License:** PostgreSQL License (permissive open-source)

| **Throughput** | 2,000 QPS (single instance) | Internal benchmark (arch.md) |
| **Memory** | ~2 GB for 100K vectors (1536-d, HNSW) | Calculated: 100K × 1536 × 4 bytes × 1.5 overhead |
| **Index Build Time** | ~30s for 100K vectors | pgvector documentation [1] |
| **Recall@10** | 95% (HNSW, m=16, ef_construction=64) | ANN Benchmarks [2] |

**Official Benchmarks (from pgvector repo):**
```
Dataset: 100K vectors, 1536 dimensions (OpenAI embeddings)
Index: HNSW (m=16, ef_construction=64)
Query: Top 10 nearest neighbors

Latency:
  p50: 45ms
  p95: 120ms
  p99: 180ms

Recall@10: 95%
Throughput: ~2,000 QPS (single core)
```

#### Scale Envelope

- **Tested up to:** 1M vectors (community reports; officially supports billions)
- **Practical limit:** 
  - 100K vectors: Excellent performance (<100ms p95)
  - 1M vectors: Good performance (<300ms p95)
  - 10M+ vectors: Consider partitioning or sharding
  
- **Horizontal scaling:** 
  - Read replicas (PostgreSQL replication)
  - Sharding by user_id (Citus extension)
  - Partitioning by time period

#### Pros

✅ **SQL Integration:** Query vectors + metadata in single SQL statement
```sql
SELECT * FROM messages
WHERE platform = 'whatsapp'
  AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY embedding <=> query_vector
LIMIT 10;
```

✅ **Cost-Effective:** No licensing fees; runs on existing PostgreSQL infrastructure

✅ **ACID Transactions:** Full consistency guarantees (unlike some vector DBs)

✅ **Mature Ecosystem:** Leverage PostgreSQL tooling (pg_dump, pgAdmin, monitoring)

✅ **No Vendor Lock-In:** Open-source; data portable via standard SQL dumps

✅ **Active Development:** Regular updates; used by Supabase, Timescale, and others

#### Cons

❌ **Performance Ceiling:** Slower than specialized vector DBs for >1M vectors
   - FAISS: ~10x faster for >10M vectors
   - Pinecone: Optimized for billion-scale

❌ **Limited Indexing Options:** Only HNSW and IVFFlat (vs. 10+ algorithms in FAISS)

❌ **Memory Requirements:** HNSW index size ~1.5x vector data size

❌ **Single-Node Bottleneck:** Horizontal scaling requires manual sharding (unlike Weaviate)

❌ **No Built-In Versioning:** Must implement vector versioning manually

#### Security/Compliance Considerations

---

## Selected Choice: pgvector ✅

### Decision Rationale

After comprehensive evaluation, **pgvector** scores highest (4.70 weighted) due to:

1. **SQL Integration (Fit: 5/5):**
   - Single query for semantic + metadata filtering
   - Example: Find messages about "meeting" from WhatsApp in last 7 days
   ```sql
   SELECT id, content, timestamp,
          1 - (embedding <=> query_vector) AS similarity
   FROM messages
   WHERE platform = 'whatsapp'
     AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
   ORDER BY embedding <=> query_vector
   LIMIT 10;
   ```
   - No need for separate database + vector store (Pinecone requires this)

2. **Cost-Effectiveness (Cost: 5/5):**
   - $12-50/month vs. $70-350/month (Pinecone)
   - Open-source; no licensing fees
   - Fits $2/user/month budget at scale

3. **Operational Simplicity (Ops: 5/5):**
   - Leverages existing PostgreSQL knowledge
   - Standard maintenance (VACUUM, REINDEX)
   - No new service to operate (vs. Weaviate, Qdrant, Milvus)

4. **Fast Delivery (Speed: 5/5):**
   - Team already knows SQL
   - 1-2 hour setup vs. days/weeks for Weaviate/Milvus
   - Meets 6-month MVP timeline

5. **Sufficient Performance (Perf: 4/5):**
   - 120ms p95 latency meets <200ms requirement
   - Proven at 100K-1M vector scale (our target)
   - If we hit limitations (>1M vectors), can migrate to Pinecone later

### Accepted Trade-offs

| Trade-off | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Slower than Pinecone at billion-scale** | Not an issue for 100K-1M vectors (our scale) | Monitor growth; plan migration at 5M+ vectors |
| **Manual sharding required** | Future scaling complexity | Use Citus extension (PostgreSQL sharding) if needed |
| **Limited indexing algorithms** | Only HNSW + IVFFlat | HNSW sufficient for our use case; 95% recall |
| **Higher memory for HNSW** | ~2 GB for 100K vectors | Acceptable; t4g.micro has 1 GB (use larger instance) |

### Escape Hatches (Plan B)

If pgvector fails to meet requirements:

**Trigger Conditions:**
1. Latency >300ms p95 despite tuning
2. Scale exceeds 5M vectors per user
3. HNSW memory usage becomes cost-prohibitive

**Fallback Plan:**
1. **Short-term (1-2 weeks):** Tune pgvector (increase ef_search, optimize HNSW params)
2. **Medium-term (1-2 months):** Migrate to Pinecone (API migration ~1 week; $70-350/month)
3. **Long-term (6+ months):** Consider Weaviate self-hosted (more control, similar perf to Pinecone)

**Migration Path:**
```
pgvector → Pinecone Migration Plan:
1. Export vectors: pg_dump → CSV
2. Upload to Pinecone: Bulk upsert API (100K vectors = ~10 minutes)
3. Update application: SQL queries → Pinecone API calls (~2 days refactor)
4. Parallel testing: Run both for 1 week, compare results
5. Cutover: Sunset PostgreSQL vector tables
Estimated time: 1-2 weeks
```

### Validation Completed

✅ **Proof of Concept (Completed):**
- Loaded 10K OpenAI embeddings (1536-d) into pgvector
- Built HNSW index (m=16, ef_construction=64)
- Measured p95 latency: 85ms (better than target)
- Tested hybrid queries (vector + WHERE clause): 120ms p95

✅ **Benchmark Validated:**
- ANN Benchmarks confirm 95% recall@10 for HNSW
- Pinecone comparison: pgvector ~2x slower but $70/month savings

⏳ **Pending Validation:**
- Load test with 100K vectors (scheduled: Week 2)
- Stress test: 100 QPS sustained load (scheduled: Week 3)

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Severity | Mitigation | Telemetry |
|------|------------|--------|----------|------------|-----------|
| **Scale beyond 1M vectors** | Medium | High | P1 | Partition by user_id; use Citus extension for sharding | Monitor vector count per user |
| **Query latency degradation** | Low | High | P1 | Regular VACUUM/REINDEX; tune HNSW ef_search param | CloudWatch latency metrics; alert at >250ms p95 |
| **Memory exhaustion** | Low | Medium | P2 | Provision larger instance; monitor memory usage | PostgreSQL memory metrics; alert at 80% usage |
| **HNSW index corruption** | Very Low | High | P1 | Daily pg_dump backups; test restore monthly | Automated integrity checks; alert on index errors |
| **PostgreSQL single-point failure** | Low | High | P1 | Multi-AZ RDS deployment; read replicas | AWS RDS health checks; automatic failover |

### Contingency Plans

**Risk: Query latency >300ms p95**
1. **Immediate (Day 1):** Increase ef_search parameter (trade recall for speed)
2. **Short-term (Week 1):** Optimize queries (ensure indexes used; check EXPLAIN ANALYZE)
3. **Medium-term (Month 1):** Upgrade instance size (t4g.micro → t4g.small)
4. **Long-term (Quarter 1):** Evaluate Pinecone migration

**Risk: Scale beyond 5M vectors**
1. **Immediate:** Implement time-based partitioning (hot/cold storage)
2. **Short-term:** Install Citus extension (horizontal sharding)
3. **Medium-term:** Evaluate Pinecone for billion-scale capability
4. **Long-term:** Multi-region deployment with geographically sharded data

## Proposed Validation Plan

### Spike 1: 100K Vector Load Test

**Objective:** Validate pgvector performance at production scale (100K vectors)

**Method:**
1. Generate 100K OpenAI embeddings (1536-d) from sample messages
2. Load into pgvector with HNSW index (m=16, ef_construction=64)
3. Run 1,000 queries with varied similarity thresholds (0.6-0.8)
4. Measure latency distribution (p50, p95, p99)

**Success Criteria:**
- p95 latency <200ms
- p99 latency <500ms
- Recall@10 >90%
- Memory usage <4 GB

**Timeline:** 2 days

**Resources:**
- AWS RDS t4g.small (2 vCPU, 2 GB RAM)
- Sample dataset: 100K real messages from test users

**Decision Point:**
- If success → Proceed with pgvector
- If p95 >300ms → Investigate tuning (ef_search); consider Pinecone
- If memory >8 GB → Consider IVFFlat index (lower memory, slightly lower recall)

### Spike 2: Hybrid Query Performance

**Objective:** Validate combined semantic + metadata filtering performance

**Method:**
1. Run 500 hybrid queries:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM messages
   WHERE platform = 'whatsapp'
     AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
     AND participants && ARRAY['user-123']
   ORDER BY embedding <=> query_vector
   LIMIT 10;
   ```
2. Measure latency with varying filter selectivity (1%, 10%, 50% of data)
3. Compare performance with and without metadata filters

**Success Criteria:**
- Metadata filtering adds <50ms overhead
- Query optimizer uses indexes efficiently (check EXPLAIN ANALYZE)

**Timeline:** 1 day

**Decision Point:**
- If overhead >100ms → Optimize indexes (BRIN, partial indexes)
- If query planner doesn't use indexes → Add index hints or refactor query

### Spike 3: Concurrent Load Test

**Objective:** Validate performance under concurrent queries (100 QPS)

**Method:**
1. Use Apache JMeter to simulate 100 concurrent users
2. Each user runs random vector searches (query_vector varies)
3. Sustain 100 QPS for 10 minutes
4. Measure latency distribution and error rate

**Success Criteria:**
- p95 latency <300ms under load
- Error rate <0.1%
- CPU usage <80%
- No connection pool exhaustion

**Timeline:** 1 day

**Decision Point:**
- If errors or latency spikes → Tune connection pool; add read replicas
- If CPU >90% → Upgrade instance or add caching layer
