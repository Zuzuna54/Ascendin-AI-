## Systematic Approach Established

### 1. Research Process (Validated)
For each decision, the process is:

**Step 1: Extract from arch.md** (30 min)
- Identify where technology is mentioned
- Extract rationale and context
- Map to project.md requirements

**Step 2: Identify Alternatives** (1 hour)
- List 3-6 realistic options
- Include current choice from arch.md
- Ensure breadth (open-source, commercial, managed, self-hosted)

**Step 3: Research Each Alternative** (3-4 hours)
- Official documentation (features, performance, pricing)
- Community feedback (GitHub issues, Stack Overflow, benchmarks)
- Academic sources (papers, standards, RFCs)
- Cost data (pricing pages, TCO calculators)

**Step 4: Comparative Analysis** (2-3 hours)
- Score against weighted criteria
- Create comparison matrix
- Document trade-offs

**Step 5: Decision Justification** (1-2 hours)
- Explain chosen option with 3-5 key reasons
- Document accepted trade-offs
- Define escape hatches

**Step 6: Risk & Validation** (1-2 hours)
- Identify top risks with mitigations
- Propose 2-3 validation spikes
- Define success criteria

**Step 7: Quality Check** (1 hour)
- Verify all citations (test URLs)
- Ensure no placeholders
- Check alignment with arch.md

**Total per Decision:** 8-10 hours  
**Total for 18 Remaining:** 144-180 hours
