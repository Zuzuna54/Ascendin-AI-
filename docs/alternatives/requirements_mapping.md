## Constraint â†’ Decision Mapping

| Constraint (from project.md) | Architectural Decision | Rationale |
|------------------------------|------------------------|-----------|
| "User in control of storage location" | Hybrid local-first + user-selectable cloud | Allows local-only, iCloud, or custom S3 |
| "Data remains isolated" | Client-side encryption + zero-knowledge cloud | Cloud cannot decrypt even if compromised |
| "Synchronized across devices" | CRDTs (conflict-free) | Automatic resolution without user intervention |
| "Privacy-preserving compute" | Ephemeral Lambda with user-provided keys | Keys never persist server-side |
| "Transparent to user" | Audit logs + transparency dashboard | User sees exactly what happens with data |
| "Third parties safe access" | Encrypted API calls + ephemeral processing | OpenAI sees plaintext only in Lambda memory |
| "Apple devices (iPhone, MacBook, iPad)" | Swift/SwiftUI native apps | Best platform integration and performance |
| "WhatsApp (Signal Protocol, QR code)" | whatsmeow library | Implements official multi-device protocol |
| "iMessage (SQLite on macOS)" | Direct SQLite access | Fast, reliable, read-only (safe) |
| "IMAP (email + calendar)" | IMAP4rev1 with OAuth 2.0 | Universal protocol; secure auth |

**Key Insight:** Architecture pattern (local-first) is the foundational decision that cascades to sync strategy, storage, and encryption choices.
