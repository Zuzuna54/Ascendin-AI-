## Validation Notes

### Requirements Not Explicitly in project.md but Derived

The following requirements were inferred from project.md's design principles and Part 1/Part 2 specifications:

- **REQ-4.x (Performance):** Derived from "compute tasks may take a long time" (project.md line 15) → quantified in arch.md §2.5
- **REQ-5.x (Security):** Derived from "user control" and "data isolation" principles → detailed in arch.md §4-§5
- **REQ-6.x (Onboarding):** Derived from Part 1 requirement to "describe user onboarding" → implemented in arch.md §1.4
- **REQ-7.x (Reliability):** Derived from "remain synchronized across multiple devices" → implemented via CRDTs in arch.md §5

These are **not deviations** but rather **explicit implementations** of implicit requirements.

## Assumption Register

| Assumption ID | Assumption | Justification | Risk if Invalid |
|---------------|------------|---------------|-----------------|
| ASM-1 | WhatsApp's 4-device limit acceptable | Primary phone acts as gateway; other devices access via vault (arch.md §1.4) | User cannot link vault if 4 devices already linked |
| ASM-2 | macOS "Full Disk Access" permission obtainable | Standard practice for messaging apps (arch.md §3.2) | iMessage integration fails on user denial |
| ASM-3 | User has email credentials (OAuth preferred) | IMAP standard requires authentication (arch.md §3.3) | Cannot access email without credentials |
| ASM-4 | 10K-100K messages per user sufficient | Covers 12 months of typical usage (arch.md §2.5) | Enterprise users may exceed; requires sharding |
| ASM-5 | OpenAI API available and stable | Commercial SLA; fallback to local models offered (arch.md §2.2) | Switch to Sentence-BERT if OpenAI unavailable |

---

## Deltas from project.md (Explicit)

| Delta ID | Description | Rationale | Requirements Still Met |
|----------|-------------|-----------|------------------------|
| DELTA-1 | Specific choice of Automerge CRDT library | project.md requires "sync across devices"; arch.md specifies implementation (§5) | REQ-2.3 ✅ |
| DELTA-2 | Specific choice of pgvector for vector search | project.md requires "semantic search"; arch.md specifies technology (§2.2) | REQ-3.1, REQ-3.2 ✅ |
| DELTA-3 | Specific choice of AES-256-GCM encryption | project.md requires "secure storage"; arch.md specifies algorithm (§4.2) | REQ-5.1 ✅ |
| DELTA-4 | Hybrid local-first + cloud architecture | project.md allows "local device or trusted third party"; arch.md chooses both (§1.1) | REQ-2.1 ✅ |
| DELTA-5 | Specific embedding model (OpenAI text-embedding-3-small) | project.md requires "semantic analysis"; arch.md specifies model (§2.2) | REQ-3.1 ✅ |

**Conclusion:** All deltas are **implementation choices** within the scope permitted by project.md. No requirement violations.
