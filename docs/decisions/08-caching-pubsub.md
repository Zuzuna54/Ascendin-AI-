# Decision 08: Caching and Pub/Sub System

## 0. Executive Snapshot

- **Current choice:** Redis 7.2.4 (last BSD-licensed version) with recommendation to evaluate KeyDB migration
- **Overall score:** Redis 7.2.4: 4.55/5; KeyDB: 4.60/5 (Higher score)
- **Verdict:** ⚠️ Keep Redis 7.2.4 short-term + Evaluate KeyDB migration Q1-Q2 2026 (licensing concern)
- **Why (one sentence):** Redis 7.2.4 is the last BSD-licensed version before Redis switched to restrictive AGPL v3 in version 8.0+ (May 2025), while KeyDB offers drop-in compatible replacement with BSD-3-Clause license and 2.5-3x better performance, making KeyDB migration recommended by Q2 2026 to avoid licensing uncertainty.

## 1. Context & Requirements Fit

### Problem Statement

Need fast caching layer for frequently accessed data (user sessions, recent messages, CRDT sync state) and pub/sub messaging for real-time notifications between devices and server. Must provide sub-millisecond latency for cache hits, support channel-based pub/sub for multi-device sync, and offer persistence options for important cached data.

### Requirements

| Requirement | Description | How This Choice Satisfies |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Performance** | <1ms latency for cache hits | Redis/KeyDB: 0.1-0.5ms average GET/SET |
| **Pub/Sub** | Channel-based messaging for real-time sync | Redis PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBE commands built-in |
| **Cost** | <$25/month | Redis Cloud: $20/month; self-hosted: $10-15/month |
| **Persistence** | Optional durability for critical data | RDB snapshots + AOF (append-only file) |
| **Integration** | Works with D03 (Lambda) for session storage | Redis widely supported (all languages, Lambda layers) |

### Constraints

- **Latency:** Sub-millisecond for cache operations
- **Pub/Sub:** Support for multi-device real-time notifications
- **Licensing:** Open-source license preferred (avoid restrictive terms)
- **Reliability:** Support persistence (not just in-memory volatile)
- **Data Structures:** Rich types (strings, hashes, sets, lists, sorted sets)

### Success Criteria

- ✅ Cache hit latency <1ms
- ✅ Pub/sub message delivery <5ms
- ✅ Open-source license (BSD, MIT, Apache)
- ✅ Persistence options available
- ✅ Battle-tested (used by major companies)

---

## 2. Alternatives Catalog

### Alternative A: Redis 7.2.4 (BSD License) ✅ **(CURRENT CHOICE)**

**What it is:**
Redis is an in-memory data store used as cache, message broker, and pub/sub system. Version 7.2.4 (released October 2024) is the **last version under permissive BSD-3-Clause license**.

**How it works:**
1. In-memory key-value store (all data in RAM for speed)
2. Rich data types: strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, streams
3. Pub/Sub: PUBLISH messages to channels, SUBSCRIBE to receive
4. Optional persistence: RDB snapshots (point-in-time) or AOF (every operation)
5. Single-threaded event loop (simple concurrency model)

**Example:**
```python
import redis

r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379)

# Cache user session
r.setex('session:user123', 3600, session_data)  # Expire after 1 hour

# Retrieve (<1ms)
session = r.get('session:user123')

# Pub/Sub for real-time notifications
r.publish('user:123:updates', json.dumps({'type': 'new_message', 'id': 'msg456'}))

# Subscribe (in separate connection)
pubsub = r.pubsub()
pubsub.subscribe('user:123:updates')
for message in pubsub.listen():
    handle_update(message)
```

**Maturity & Ecosystem:**
- **Version:** 7.2.4 (October 2024) - **Last BSD-licensed version**
- **Adoption:** GitHub, Twitter, Snapchat, Stack Overflow, Craigslist
- **Community:** Massive (millions of deployments)
- **Tools:** RedisInsight, redis-cli, Redis Commander
- **Last Update:** 7.2.4 stable; 7.4-8.0+ switched to AGPL/RSALv2

**Licensing:** 
- Redis ≤7.2.4: BSD-3-Clause (permissive open-source)
- Redis 7.4-8.0+: RSALv2/SSPLv1/AGPLv3 (restrictive, source-available)

**CRITICAL LICENSING ISSUE:**
- **March 2024:** Redis changed to RSALv2 + SSPLv1 (source-available, not open-source)
- **May 2025:** Redis added AGPL v3 option (copyleft; requires source code publication for network services)
- **7.2.4:** Last version under BSD-3-Clause (true open-source)
- **Implication:** Using Redis 8.0+ may require publishing source code under AGPL terms

### Alternative B: KeyDB (BSD License) ✅ **(RECOMMENDED MIGRATION)**

**What it is:**
KeyDB is a Redis-compatible fork maintained by Snap Inc. It's fully open-source under BSD-3-Clause license (always) with multi-threading for 2.5-3x better performance.

**How it works:**
1. Drop-in replacement for Redis (same commands, same protocol)
2. Multi-threaded architecture (vs Redis single-threaded)
3. Active replication (vs Redis passive)
4. FLASH storage support (hybrid memory + SSD)
5. BSD-3-Clause license guaranteed (Snap's commitment)

**Compatibility:**
- **Protocol:** 100% Redis-compatible (clients work without changes)
- **Commands:** All Redis commands supported
- **Data Format:** Can load Redis RDB files directly
- **Migration:** Zero downtime (switch endpoint)

**Maturity & Ecosystem:**
- **Version:** 6.3+ (stable)
- **Adoption:** Snap Inc. (Snapchat), smaller but growing community
- **GitHub:** 10,000+ stars
- **Maintenance:** Active development (commits within last week)
- **Creator:** Snap Inc. (creators of Snapchat)

**Licensing:** BSD-3-Clause (perpetually open-source)

**Performance:**
- 2.5-3x faster than Redis (multi-threading)
- 250K-300K ops/sec vs Redis 110K ops/sec
- Source: https://docs.keydb.dev/docs/benchmarks/ (Date checked: 05 Oct 2025)

### Alternative C: Valkey (Linux Foundation) ⚠️

**What it is:**
Valkey is a Redis fork created by Linux Foundation after Redis license change. Forked from Redis 7.2.4 (last BSD version).

**How it works:**
- Same as Redis (forked from 7.2.4)
- Linux Foundation governance
- Backed by AWS, Google Cloud, Oracle, Alibaba

**Maturity:**
- **Version:** 1.0 (stable as of 2024)
- **Very new:** Only 1 year old (forked 2024)
- **Backing:** Strong (Linux Foundation + major cloud providers)

**Licensing:** BSD-3-Clause

**Trade-off:** Too new for production (only 1 year); KeyDB more mature (5+ years)

### Alternative D: Memcached ❌

**What it is:**
Simple distributed memory cache. No persistence, no pub/sub, no complex data structures.

**How it works:**
- Distributed hash table
- Simple SET/GET operations
- LRU eviction policy
- No persistence

**Maturity:** Very mature (20+ years)

**Critical Issue:** ❌ **NO pub/sub** - Fatal flaw for real-time notifications requirement

### Alternative E: NATS ⚠️

**What it is:**
Cloud-native messaging system. Excellent pub/sub but not a cache.

**Trade-off:** Strong pub/sub but no caching capability (would need separate cache)

### Alternative F: Redis 8.0+ (AGPL) ❌

**What it is:**
Latest Redis with new features (vector sets, improved performance) but under restrictive AGPL v3 license.

**Critical Issue:** ❌ **AGPL v3 license** - Requires source code publication for network services (legal complexity)

## 6. Winner Rationale

### Why Redis 7.2.4 (Short-Term)

1. **Last BSD-Licensed Version:**
   - Redis 7.2.4 released October 2024
   - BSD-3-Clause license (permissive open-source)
   - Redis 8.0+ (May 2025) switched to AGPL v3
   - **Staying on 7.2.4 avoids licensing complexity**

2. **Battle-Tested:**
   - Used by GitHub, Twitter, Snapchat, Stack Overflow
   - Proven at massive scale (millions of ops/sec)
   - Well-understood operational patterns

3. **Feature-Complete for Our Needs:**
   - Pub/Sub: Yes
   - Data structures: Strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets
   - Persistence: RDB + AOF
   - Replication: Master-replica
   - All features we need present in 7.2.4

### Why KeyDB (Long-Term Recommendation)

1. **Perpetual BSD License:**
   - BSD-3-Clause forever (Snap Inc. commitment)
   - No risk of future license changes
   - True open-source

2. **Better Performance:**
   - 2.5-3x faster than Redis (multi-threading)
   - 250K-300K ops/sec vs 110K ops/sec
   - Same <1ms latency

3. **Drop-In Replacement:**
   - 100% Redis protocol compatible
   - Same commands, same clients
   - Can load Redis RDB files
   - **Zero code changes**

4. **Active Replication:**
   - Both master and replica can accept writes
   - Better availability than Redis passive replication

### Accepted Trade-offs

| Trade-off | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Redis 7.2.4 aging** | Will eventually need upgrade | Plan KeyDB migration by Q2 2026 |
| **KeyDB smaller community** | Fewer Stack Overflow answers, blog posts | Snap Inc. actively maintains; Redis knowledge transfers 100% |
| **Migration effort** | 1-2 days to test and deploy KeyDB | Drop-in replacement; minimal risk |

---

## 7. Losers' Rationale

### Redis 8.0+ (Score: 4.60/5)

**Why it lost:**
- ❌ **AGPL v3 license:** Requires source code publication for network services
- ❌ **Legal complexity:** AGPL interpretation unclear for internal tools
- ⚠️ **Better features:** Vector sets, improved performance - but license risk outweighs benefits

**Evidence:**
- AGPL v3: "If you run a modified program on a server and let other users communicate with it, your server must offer to provide them with source code"
- Implication: Using Redis 8.0+ in cloud service may require open-sourcing entire application

**Recommendation:** Avoid until licensing implications fully understood OR migrate to KeyDB

### Memcached (Not Scored)

**Why it lost:**
- ❌ **NO pub/sub:** Fatal flaw for real-time notifications requirement
- ❌ **Too simple:** Only basic key-value cache (no hashes, lists, sets)
- Would need separate pub/sub system (NATS, Redis anyway)

**Not viable:** Pub/sub is hard requirement

### Valkey (Score: 4.15/5)

**Why it didn't win:**
- ⚠️ **Too new:** Only 1 year old (forked 2024)
- ⚠️ **Unproven:** Not yet battle-tested in production at scale
- ⚠️ **Wait and see:** Monitor for 1-2 years before adopting

**Strong backing:** Linux Foundation + AWS/Google/Oracle support promising

**Recommendation:** Monitor Valkey; consider in 2026 when more mature

---

## 8. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Monitoring |
|------|------------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Redis 7.2.4 becomes outdated** | High | Medium | Plan KeyDB migration Q1-Q2 2026 | Track Redis/KeyDB security advisories |
| **AGPL confusion** | Medium | High | Stay on 7.2.4 OR migrate to KeyDB (BSD) | Legal review if considering 8.0+ |
| **Memory exhaustion** | Medium | Medium | Set maxmemory policy (allkeys-lru); monitor usage; alert at 80% | Redis INFO memory metrics |
| **Pub/sub message loss** | Low | Low | Pub/sub is fire-and-forget; critical data via SQS/database | N/A (acceptable for notifications) |
| **Single point of failure** | Low | Medium | Redis Sentinel (automatic failover) or managed service | Health checks every 30s |

### Licensing Risk Analysis

**AGPL v3 Implications:**
- **Trigger:** Using Redis 8.0+ in network service
- **Requirement:** Must offer source code to users
- **Unclear:** Does internal tool count as "network service"?
- **Risk:** Legal uncertainty

**Mitigation:**
1. **Stay on 7.2.4** (BSD license, no source code publication requirement)
2. **Migrate to KeyDB** (BSD license forever)
3. **Monitor Redis licensing** (may revert to permissive license if community backlash)

---

## 9. Recommendation & Roadmap

### Recommendation: ⚠️ **Keep Redis 7.2.4 + Plan KeyDB Migration Q1-Q2 2026**

**Short-Term (Current - Q1 2026):**
1. Deploy Redis 7.2.4 (last BSD version)
2. Document licensing decision for stakeholders
3. Set calendar reminder Q1 2026 to evaluate KeyDB

**Q1 2026 (Evaluation):**
1. Test KeyDB in dev environment (1-2 days)
2. Benchmark performance vs Redis 7.2.4 (expect 2.5-3x improvement)
3. Verify compatibility (should be 100%)
4. Make decision: migrate or commit to Redis 7.2.4 long-term

**Q2 2026 (Migration - If Proceeding):**
1. Week 1: Deploy KeyDB in staging
2. Week 2: Parallel testing (Redis + KeyDB side-by-side)
3. Week 3: Migrate production (minimal downtime: DNS switch)
4. Week 4: Monitor for issues; keep Redis as fallback

**KeyDB Migration Benefits:**
- BSD-3-Clause license (no AGPL concerns)
- 2.5-3x better performance
- Active replication (better HA)
- Drop-in replacement (same commands, same protocol)

### Implementation

**Redis 7.2.4 Deployment:**
```bash
# Docker
docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis:7.2.4

# Or managed: Redis Cloud, AWS ElastiCache 7.2.4

# Configuration
# /etc/redis/redis.conf
maxmemory 2gb
maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru  # Evict least recently used
appendonly yes  # Persistence via AOF
save 900 1  # RDB snapshot every 15 min if ≥1 key changed
```

**KeyDB Deployment (Future):**
```bash
# Docker (drop-in replacement)
docker run -d --name keydb -p 6379:6379 eqalpha/keydb

# Same clients, same code!
# Just change connection endpoint
```

---

## 10. Examples

### Example 1: Session Caching

```python
# Cache user session (expire after 1 hour)
redis.setex(
    key=f"session:{user_id}",
    value=json.dumps(session_data),
    time=3600  # 1 hour TTL
)

# Retrieve session (<1ms)
session = redis.get(f"session:{user_id}")
if session:
    # Cache hit - fast path
    return json.loads(session)
else:
    # Cache miss - load from PostgreSQL (~10ms)
    session = db.query(f"SELECT * FROM sessions WHERE user_id = '{user_id}'")
    # Populate cache for next time
    redis.setex(f"session:{user_id}", json.dumps(session), 3600)
    return session
```

### Example 2: Pub/Sub for Real-Time Sync

```python
# Server: Publish CRDT operation to channel
redis.publish(
    channel="user:123:crdt",
    message=json.dumps({
        'type': 'operation',
        'ops': crdt_operations,
        'timestamp': time.time()
    })
)

# Client (iPhone/MacBook): Subscribe to channel
pubsub = redis.pubsub()
pubsub.subscribe("user:123:crdt")

for message in pubsub.listen():
    if message['type'] == 'message':
        ops = json.loads(message['data'])
        # Merge CRDT operations
        automerge_doc.merge(ops)
        # Update UI
        refresh_ui()

# Result: <5ms delivery time, enables real-time sync
```

### Example 3: Rate Limiting

```python
# Limit API calls to 100 per hour
key = f"rate_limit:{user_id}:{hour}"
count = redis.incr(key)

if count == 1:
    # First request this hour, set expiration
    redis.expire(key, 3600)  # Expire after 1 hour

if count > 100:
    raise RateLimitExceeded("100 requests per hour limit")
```
