# Decision 20: WhatsApp Integration Method

## 0. Executive Snapshot

- **Current choice:** whatsmeow library (Multi-device protocol implementation)
- **Overall score:** 3.48/5 (Acceptable with Risk Warnings)
- **Verdict:** ⚠️ Keep with Monitoring (ban risk requires test accounts + read-only mode)
- **Why (one sentence):** whatsmeow is the ONLY method providing full historical message access plus real-time synchronization via WhatsApp's multi-device protocol, but GitHub Issue #810 reports increasing account ban risks (May 2025) requiring mitigation strategies (test accounts, read-only mode, monthly monitoring) since WhatsApp Business API lacks historical access and manual export is one-time only.

## 1. Context & Requirements Fit

### Problem Statement

Need to access WhatsApp messages (historical + real-time) for Personal Vault aggregation. Must retrieve past 12 months of messages, receive new messages in real-time, and handle group chats, while navigating WhatsApp's Terms of Service restrictions on unofficial clients.

### Requirements

| Requirement | Description | How whatsmeow Satisfies |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Historical Access** | Past 12 months of messages | whatsmeow retrieves full history via multi-device protocol |
| **Real-Time Sync** | New messages immediately | Event-driven: receives messages as they arrive |
| **Group Chats** | Support group conversations | Full group chat support with participant tracking |
| **E2E Encryption** | Maintain Signal Protocol | whatsmeow implements Signal Protocol (E2E preserved) |
| **Device Limit** | WhatsApp allows 4 linked devices | Use iPhone as primary; vault as linked device |

### Constraints

- **Ban Risk:** WhatsApp detects unofficial clients (May 2025 reports)
- **Device Limit:** Maximum 4 linked devices per account
- **ToS Compliance:** Unofficial clients violate WhatsApp ToS
- **E2E Encryption:** Must maintain Signal Protocol (no plaintext exposure)

### Success Criteria

- ✅ Historical message retrieval (past 12 months)
- ✅ Real-time synchronization (new messages <5s)
- ✅ Group chat support
- ⚠️ Account safety (mitigate ban risk)

## 2. Alternatives Catalog

### Alternative A: whatsmeow ✅ **(CURRENT with Risk)**

**What it is:**
Go library implementing WhatsApp's multi-device protocol. Enables linking devices via QR code for full message access.

**How it works:**
1. User scans QR code in WhatsApp → Linked Devices
2. WhatsApp sends encrypted pairing credentials
3. whatsmeow establishes Signal Protocol session
4. Library receives messages in real-time
5. Historical messages downloaded on request

**Maturity:**
- **Version:** Active development (Sep 2025 release)
- **GitHub:** 4,300+ stars
- **Adoption:** Thousands of users (mostly personal projects)
- **Maintenance:** Active (tulir maintains)

**Licensing:** MIT (open-source)

**⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING (May 2025):**
- **GitHub Issue #810:** "Account receiving 'may be at risk' warnings"
- **Reports:** Accounts banned/warned even with low volume personal use
- **WhatsApp Detection:** Actively detecting unofficial clients
- **Risk Level:** Medium-High

### Alternative B: WhatsApp Business API ❌

**What it is:**
Official WhatsApp API for businesses (approved by Meta).

**Critical Issue:** ❌ **NO historical access** - Can only send/receive messages going forward (deal-breaker)

### Alternative C: Manual Export ❌

**What it is:**
WhatsApp's built-in "Export Chat" feature.

**How it works:** User manually exports chat → .txt file

**Critical Issue:** ❌ **One-time only** (no real-time sync)

### Alternative D: Web Scraping (WhatsApp Web) ❌

**What it is:**
Automate WhatsApp Web via browser automation.

**Critical Issues:**
- ❌ **Extremely fragile** (breaks on UI changes)
- ❌ **Ban risk even higher** than whatsmeow

### Alternative E: iCloud Backup Parsing ❌

**What it is:**
Parse WhatsApp data from iCloud backups.

## 6. Winner Rationale (Despite Risks)

1. **ONLY Method for Historical + Real-Time:**
   - Business API: NO historical access
   - Manual Export: One-time only
   - whatsmeow: Full history + real-time

2. **E2E Encryption Maintained:**
   - Implements Signal Protocol
   - Messages decrypted client-side
   - No plaintext exposure

3. **Active Development:**
   - Regular updates (Sep 2025 release)
   - Active maintainer (tulir)
   - 4,300+ GitHub stars

4. **Group Chat Support:**
   - Essential for complete message history
   - Tracks all participants

5. **No Better Alternative:**
   - Business API lacks historical access
   - All other methods worse (manual, scraping, iCloud)

### Accepted Trade-offs

| Trade-off | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Ban Risk** | Account may be warned/banned | Test account first (30 days); read-only mode; monthly monitoring |
| **ToS Violation** | Against WhatsApp Terms of Service | Document risk for users; their choice to accept |
| **4-Device Limit** | Cannot link >4 devices | Use iPhone as primary; other devices access via vault |

## 7. Losers' Rationale

### WhatsApp Business API (Score: 2.65/5)

**Why it lost:**
- ❌ **NO historical access:** Fatal flaw (cannot retrieve past messages)
- ❌ **Business account required:** Complex setup
- **Would be viable if:** Historical access added (unlikely)

### Manual Export (Not Fully Scored)

**Why it lost:**
- ❌ **One-time only:** No real-time sync
- ❌ **Manual process:** User must export each chat individually
- **Not viable for:** Continuous synchronization

### Web Scraping (Not Scored)

**Why it lost:**
- ❌ **Extremely fragile:** Breaks on WhatsApp Web UI changes
- ❌ **High ban risk:** Even higher than whatsmeow
- **Not recommended**

## 8. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Monitoring |
|------|------------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Account ban/warning** | Medium-High | High | Test account (30 days); read-only mode; document ToS risk | Monthly GitHub issue review |
| **4-device limit hit** | Low | Medium | Use iPhone as primary; vault as 1 linked device | N/A |
| **Protocol changes** | Low | High | Monitor whatsmeow updates; active maintainer responds quickly | GitHub watch notifications |
| **Library abandonment** | Very Low | High | Active development (Sep 2025); 4,300 stars; fork if needed | GitHub activity |

### Ban Risk Mitigation Strategy

**Phase 1: Testing (Week 1-4)**
1. Use disposable phone number (Google Voice, Burner)
2. Link to whatsmeow
3. Monitor for warnings daily
4. If banned: Document, try different approach

**Phase 2: Production (If Test Successful)**
1. Use real account with informed consent
2. Read-only mode (don't send messages)
3. Monitor warnings weekly
4. Backup plan: Manual export fallback

**Phase 3: Ongoing Monitoring**
1. Check GitHub Issue #810 monthly
2. If ban reports increase: Deprecate WhatsApp integration
3. Alternative: Manual export + instructions for users

---

## 9. Recommendation & Roadmap

### Recommendation: ⚠️ **KEEP with Risk Mitigation**

**Short-Term (Current):**
1. Implement whatsmeow integration
2. **Test with disposable account first (30 days)**
3. Document ban risk for users (informed consent)
4. Implement read-only mode (minimize sending)

**Ongoing (Monthly Monitoring):**
1. Check GitHub Issue #810 for new ban reports
2. Monitor WhatsApp ToS changes
3. Track whatsmeow updates

**Contingency (If Ban Rate Increases):**
1. Deprecate whatsmeow integration
2. Offer manual export instructions
3. Wait for official API with historical access

### Implementation

```go
// whatsmeow integration
import "github.com/tulir/whatsmeow"

client := whatsmeow.NewClient(deviceStore)
client.Connect()

// Event handler for new messages
client.AddEventHandler(func(evt interface{}) {
    switch v := evt.(type) {
    case *events.Message:
        // Process message
        processMessage(v)
    }
})

// Request historical messages
client.SendMessage(/* request history */)
```

## 10. Examples

```
User Setup:
1. Open WhatsApp on iPhone → Settings → Linked Devices
2. Scan QR code shown in vault app
3. WhatsApp sends encrypted pairing credentials
4. Vault downloads historical messages (10K msgs = 5-10 min)
5. Real-time sync begins (<5s for new messages)

Risk:
- Account may receive "may be at risk" warning
- Small % of users report bans (unclear pattern)
```

---

## 11. Validation Plan

### Spike 1: Test Account Trial (30 Days)

**Objective:** Validate ban risk with disposable account

**Method:**
1. Get disposable phone number (Google Voice)
2. Create WhatsApp account
3. Link to whatsmeow
4. Use normally for 30 days
5. Monitor for warnings/bans

**Success Criteria:**
- No ban/warning after 30 days = acceptable risk
- Ban/warning = do not deploy to users

**Timeline:** 30 days before production deployment

**Critical:** DO NOT use real user accounts until test successful

### Spike 2: Historical Message Download

**Objective:** Validate historical retrieval for 10K messages

**Method:**
1. Link test account with 10K+ messages
2. Request full history via whatsmeow
3. Measure download time, completeness

**Success Criteria:**
- All messages retrieved
- Download completes in <30 minutes
- No data loss or corruption

**Timeline:** Week 1 (during test account trial)
