## 1. Context & Requirements Fit

### Problem Statement

Need to process message text for tokenization, named entity recognition (NER), part-of-speech tagging, and language detection across 70+ languages. Must run locally for privacy, work efficiently on CPU (no GPU required), use minimal memory for mobile deployment, and provide production-grade performance.

### Requirements

| Requirement | Description | How spaCy Satisfies |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Privacy** | Local processing (no cloud APIs) | 100% local; zero API calls |
| **Languages** | Support 70+ languages | spaCy has 70+ language models |
| **Performance** | <100ms processing per message | spaCy: ~10ms per message (10K words/sec) |
| **Memory** | <100MB model size | Small models: 12MB; suitable for mobile |
| **Features** | Tokenization, NER, POS, language detection | All included in spaCy |

### Constraints

- **Local Processing:** No cloud APIs (privacy requirement)
- **CPU-Only:** Must work without GPU (iPhone/iPad don't have CUDA)
- **Memory:** <100MB for mobile deployment
- **Multi-Language:** Support English, Spanish, German, Chinese, Arabic, etc.
- **Production-Ready:** Optimized for speed (not research/prototyping)

### Success Criteria

- ✅ Process 1,000 messages in <1 second (spaCy: 10K words/sec)
- ✅ Support 70+ languages (spaCy: 70+ models)
- ✅ Model size <100MB (spaCy small: 12MB)
- ✅ Local processing (100% private)
- ✅ Production-grade accuracy (85-95%)

## 2. Alternatives Catalog

### Alternative A: spaCy ✅ **(CURRENT CHOICE)**

**What it is:**
spaCy is an industrial-strength NLP library designed for production use. Created by Explosion AI, it's optimized for speed (Cython implementation) and provides pre-trained models for 70+ languages.

**How it works:**
1. Load language model (one-time, 12MB-560MB depending on model size)
2. Process text through pipeline: tokenizer → tagger → parser → NER
3. Returns Doc object with linguistic annotations
4. All processing local (no API calls)
5. CPU-optimized (uses Cython for speed)

**Example:**
```python
import spacy

# Load model (one-time)
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")  # 12MB small model

# Process message
message = "Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion"
doc = nlp(message)

# Tokenization
tokens = [token.text for token in doc]
# ['Apple', 'is', 'looking', 'at', 'buying', 'U.K.', 'startup', ...]

# Named Entity Recognition
entities = [(ent.text, ent.label_) for ent in doc.ents]
# [('Apple', 'ORG'), ('U.K.', 'GPE'), ('$1 billion', 'MONEY')]

# Part-of-speech tagging
pos = [(token.text, token.pos_) for token in doc]
# [('Apple', 'PROPN'), ('is', 'AUX'), ('looking', 'VERB'), ...]
```

**Maturity & Ecosystem:**
- **Version:** 3.7+ (stable, Oct 2024)

### Alternative B: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) ❌

**What it is:**
Academic NLP library from University of Pennsylvania. Comprehensive toolkit with many algorithms but not optimized for production.

**How it works:**
1. Collection of NLP algorithms and corpora
2. String-based processing (not optimized)
3. Good for learning and research
4. Slower than production libraries

**Maturity:** Extremely mature (25+ years, since 2001)

**Critical Issue:** ❌ **10x slower** than spaCy (1,000 words/sec vs 10,000 words/sec)

**Licensing:** Apache 2.0

### Alternative C: Transformers (Hugging Face) ⚠️

**What it is:**
State-of-the-art neural network models (BERT, RoBERTa, GPT) for highest accuracy NLP tasks.

**How it works:**
1. Load pre-trained transformer model (BERT, RoBERTa, etc.)
2. Process text through neural network
3. Highest accuracy but requires GPU for speed
4. Large models (500MB-1.4GB)

**Maturity:** Very mature (library since 2018, models since 2017)

**Critical Issue:** ❌ **Requires GPU** for reasonable performance (5-10 sec/message on CPU vs 50ms with GPU)

**Licensing:** Apache 2.0

### Alternative D: Stanford CoreNLP ❌

**What it is:**
Java-based NLP toolkit from Stanford University. Very accurate but slow.

**How it works:**
1. Java-based processing
2. Rule-based and statistical models
3. Requires JVM

**Critical Issue:** ❌ **Java-only** (incompatible with Swift/Python ecosystem)

### Alternative E: Apache OpenNLP ❌

**What it is:**
Apache project for NLP. Java-based.

**Critical Issue:** ❌ **Java-only** + less mature than spaCy/CoreNLP

   - spaCy: 10,000 words/sec on CPU
   - NLTK: 1,000 words/sec
   - **Critical for real-time processing**

2. **70+ Languages:**
   - English, Spanish, German, French, Italian, Portuguese
   - Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Russian
   - **Most comprehensive multilingual support**

3. **Lightweight Models (12MB):**
   - Suitable for mobile deployment
   - vs Transformers: 440MB-1.4GB (too large)

   - 100% local processing
   - No API calls
   - Data never leaves device

5. **Production Battle-Tested:**
   - Used by Apple, Facebook, Microsoft
   - Designed for production (not academic research)

### Accepted Trade-offs

| Trade-off | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Not SOTA accuracy (vs Transformers)** | 90% vs 98% NER | Acceptable for production; can use Transformers for high-accuracy tasks |
| **Model download** | 12-560MB download | One-time; cache locally |

---

## 7. Losers' Rationale

**NLTK:** 10x slower, academic-focused, not production-optimized  
**Transformers:** Requires GPU, 500MB-1.4GB models (too large for mobile)  
**CoreNLP/OpenNLP:** Java-only (platform incompatible)

## 8. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Model size (560MB for large)** | Use small model (12MB) for mobile; large for server |
| **Language detection errors** | Use langdetect library; fallback to English |

---

## 9. Recommendation & Roadmap

✅ **KEEP** spaCy with small models (12MB) for mobile; large models (560MB) for server

**Implementation:**
```python
pip install spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm  # English small
python -m spacy download es_core_news_sm  # Spanish
python -m spacy download de_core_news_sm  # German
```

---

## 10. Examples

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

message = "Meeting with John Smith at Apple HQ about $2M deal"
doc = nlp(message)

# Extract entities
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(f"{ent.text}: {ent.label_}")
# Output:
# John Smith: PERSON
# Apple HQ: ORG
# $2M: MONEY
```

## 11. Validation Plan

**Spike:** Process 1,000 multilingual messages; measure speed and accuracy  
**Success:** <1 second total, >85% NER accuracy  
**Timeline:** Week 1
