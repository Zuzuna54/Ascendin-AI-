## D13 — SYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION

### 1. Decision ID & Title
**D13 — Symmetric Encryption Algorithm**

### 2. Current Choice (from Source A)
**AES-256-GCM** — Advanced Encryption Standard with 256-bit keys in Galois/Counter Mode (authenticated encryption).

### 3. Scope & Context (Plain English)
**Problem:** Need to encrypt user data at rest (local database, cloud backups) and in transit. Must be secure against current and near-future attacks, fast enough for mobile devices, and provide authentication to prevent tampering.

**Constraints:**
- Security: Resistance to known attacks, quantum-resistant (256-bit keys)
- Performance: Hardware acceleration available on iOS/macOS
- Authentication: Built-in integrity verification (detect tampering)
- Standards compliance: NIST/FIPS approved
- Key size: 256-bit minimum for long-term security

**Related Requirements:** Fundamental to all data security (REQ-2.2 data isolation).

### 4. Winner Rationale (Why this choice)
- **NIST/FIPS approved:** Federal standard (FIPS 197) for US government
- **Hardware accelerated:** AES-NI (Intel), ARM Crypto Extensions (Apple Silicon)
- **Authenticated encryption:** GCM mode provides both confidentiality and integrity
- **Performance:** 2-10 GB/sec with hardware acceleration
- **Quantum-resistant:** 256-bit keys secure against Grover's algorithm
- **Battle-tested:** Used by WhatsApp, Signal, Apple FileVault, BitLocker

### 5. Alternatives Considered (How they work)

**A. ChaCha20-Poly1305**  
Modern stream cipher with Poly1305 authenticator.

**How it works:** ChaCha20 stream cipher XORs keystream with plaintext. Poly1305 MAC for authentication. Fast on devices without AES hardware acceleration.

**B. AES-256-CBC + HMAC-SHA256**  
AES in Cipher Block Chaining mode with separate MAC.

**How it works:** AES-CBC encrypts blocks in chains (each block depends on previous). HMAC-SHA256 provides separate authentication. Encrypt-then-MAC pattern.

**C. XSalsa20-Poly1305**  
Extended-nonce variant of Salsa20 with Poly1305.

**How it works:** Similar to ChaCha20 but with larger nonce (192-bit). Easier nonce management. Used by NaCl/libsodium crypto library.

**D. AES-128-GCM**  
Same as AES-256-GCM but with 128-bit keys.

**How it works:** Identical algorithm but smaller key size. Faster but less security margin. Still considered secure but 256-bit preferred for long-term data.

### 6. Alternatives Comparison Table

| Option | Pros | Cons | Requirements Fit | Ecosystem/Maturity | Ops Complexity |
|--------|------|------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **AES-256-GCM** (Current) | Hardware accelerated, NIST approved, authenticated, quantum-resistant | Slightly slower without hardware | ✅ Meets all REQs | Extremely mature (25+ years) | Low |
| ChaCha20-Poly1305 | Fast on ARM without AES-NI, modern, authenticated | Not FIPS approved, newer (less tested) | ✅ Meets REQs | Mature (10 years) | Low |
| AES-CBC + HMAC | Well understood, FIPS approved | Two operations (encrypt + MAC), timing attacks possible | ⚠️ More complex | Very mature | Medium |
| XSalsa20-Poly1305 | Easier nonce management, authenticated | Less common, not FIPS approved | ✅ Meets REQs | Mature | Low |
| AES-128-GCM | Faster than AES-256 | ❌ 128-bit keys less quantum-resistant | ⚠️ Security concern | Extremely mature | Low |

### 7. Scorecard (Unified 1.0–5.0 Scale)

- **Overhead:** <5% CPU with hardware acceleration
- **Battery impact:** Negligible with hardware AES
- **GCM authentication:** No additional overhead (parallelizable)

### 10. Security, Privacy & Compliance
- **FIPS 197 approved:** US Federal standard since 2001
- **NIST recommended:** SP 800-38D (GCM mode specification)
- **Quantum resistance:** 256-bit keys provide ~128-bit post-quantum security
- **No known practical attacks:** AES-256 unbroken for 25+ years
- **Authenticated encryption:** GCM provides both confidentiality and integrity
- **IV requirements:** 96-bit random IV (never reuse)

### 11. Critical Findings
- **Hardware acceleration critical:** AES-256-GCM 10-20x faster with AES-NI/ARM Crypto
- **Apple Silicon support:** All iOS devices since iPhone 5s have hardware AES
- **GCM vs CBC:** GCM provides authentication (detect tampering), CBC does not
- **Key size matters:** 256-bit future-proof, 128-bit borderline for long-term data
- **IV management:** Must use unique IV for each encryption (96-bit random sufficient)

### 12. Losers' Rationale
**ChaCha20-Poly1305 (score: 4.79):**
- **No hardware acceleration:** Slower on devices with AES-NI
- **Not FIPS approved:** May be issue for compliance
- **Would be better for:** Devices without hardware AES support

**AES-CBC+HMAC (score: 4.30):**
- **Two operations:** Encrypt then MAC (complexity)
- **Timing attacks:** CBC mode vulnerable if not implemented carefully
- **GCM superior:** Authenticated encryption in single operation

**AES-128-GCM (score: 4.64):**
- **Smaller keys:** 128-bit provides less security margin
- **Quantum concerns:** 2^64 post-quantum security borderline
- **Long-term data:** 256-bit preferred for data stored for years

### 13. Verdict
**AES-256-GCM is optimal** for symmetric encryption. Hardware accelerated (3 GB/sec on modern iOS devices), NIST/FIPS approved, authenticated encryption, quantum-resistant 256-bit keys. Perfect security/performance balance.

### 14. Recommendation
**KEEP** AES-256-GCM. Use Apple CryptoKit implementation (hardware accelerated).

**Implementation priorities:**
1. Use CryptoKit (Apple's native crypto library)
2. Generate 256-bit keys from user password (via PBKDF2, see D14)
3. Use 96-bit random IVs (never reuse)
4. Store IV with ciphertext (IV is not secret)
5. Verify GCM authentication tag before decryption

**Swift example:**
```swift
import CryptoKit

// Encrypt
let key = SymmetricKey(size: .bits256)  // From PBKDF2
let plaintext = "Sensitive message".data(using: .utf8)!
let sealedBox = try! AES.GCM.seal(plaintext, using: key)

// Encrypted data includes IV and authentication tag
let ciphertext = sealedBox.combined  // IV + ciphertext + tag

// Decrypt
let sealedBox2 = try! AES.GCM.SealedBox(combined: ciphertext)
let decrypted = try! AES.GCM.open(sealedBox2, using: key)
```

### 15. Validation Plan (Actionable)
**Week 1: CryptoKit Integration**
- Success criteria: Encrypt/decrypt 1GB in <1 second
- Test: Encrypt large dataset, measure throughput
- Measure: Encryption speed, CPU usage, battery impact

**Week 2: Security Validation**
- Success criteria: Verify hardware acceleration active
- Test: Compare performance with/without hardware AES
- Measure: 10-20x speedup confirms hardware usage

**Week 3: Authentication Testing**
- Success criteria: Tampered ciphertext detected
- Test: Modify ciphertext, verify decryption fails
- Measure: Authentication tag validation working

### 16. Examples (Beginner-Friendly)

**Example 1: Why Authenticated Encryption Matters**
```
Without authentication (AES-CBC only):
1. Attacker intercepts encrypted message
2. Attacker modifies ciphertext (flips bits)
3. Decryption succeeds but produces corrupted plaintext
4. Application processes corrupted data (security issue)

With authenticated encryption (AES-GCM):
1. Attacker intercepts encrypted message
2. Attacker modifies ciphertext
3. Authentication tag verification FAILS
4. Decryption rejected (attacker detected)
```

**Example 2: Performance Comparison**
```
iPhone 15 Pro encrypting 1GB database:

Software-only AES: ~5-10 seconds
Hardware AES-256-GCM: ~0.3 seconds (20x faster)

Battery impact:
Software: Significant drain (high CPU)
Hardware: Negligible (dedicated crypto engine)
```

### 1. Decision ID & Title
**D14 — Key Derivation Function (KDF)**

### 2. Current Choice (from Source A)
**PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (600,000 iterations)** — Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 with HMAC-SHA256.

### 3. Scope & Context (Plain English)
**Problem:** Need to derive 256-bit encryption keys from user passwords. Must be slow enough to resist brute-force attacks but fast enough for acceptable user experience (~1 second max).

**Constraints:**
- Security: Resist GPU/ASIC brute-force attacks
- OWASP compliance: Meet 2023 recommendations
- Performance: <1 second key derivation on iPhone
- Hardware: Use platform-native implementations
- Salt: Unique per user

**Related Requirements:** Depends on D13 (needs 256-bit keys for AES-256-GCM).

### 4. Winner Rationale (Why this choice)
- **OWASP compliant:** 600K iterations meets 2023 minimum (310K)
- **Hardware support:** Built into iOS (CommonCrypto), fast implementation
- **FIPS approved:** NIST SP 800-132 standard
- **Battle-tested:** Used for 20+ years, well understood
- **Acceptable performance:** ~400-600ms on iPhone 15
- **Simple:** No memory requirements (unlike Argon2id/scrypt)

### 5. Alternatives Considered (How they work)

**A. Argon2id**  
Winner of Password Hashing Competition (2015). Memory-hard algorithm.

**How it works:** Fills large memory buffer (64MB typical) with pseudorandom data. Resistant to GPU/ASIC attacks due to memory requirements. Combines Argon2i (data-independent) and Argon2d (data-dependent) for security.

**B. scrypt**  
Memory-hard KDF designed to resist ASIC attacks.

**How it works:** Requires large memory (32MB typical) during computation. Memory-hard makes parallelization expensive. Used by Litecoin, Tarsnap.

**C. PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512**  
Same as PBKDF2-SHA256 but with SHA-512 hash function.

**How it works:** Identical to PBKDF2-SHA256 but produces longer output. SHA-512 can be faster on 64-bit systems. 600K iterations typical.

**D. bcrypt**  
Password hashing algorithm based on Blowfish cipher.

**How it works:** Designed for password storage (not key derivation). Uses cost parameter (work factor). Slower than PBKDF2 but less configurable.

### 6. Alternatives Comparison Table

| Option | Pros | Cons | Requirements Fit | Ecosystem/Maturity | Ops Complexity |
|--------|------|------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **PBKDF2-SHA256 600K** (Current) | FIPS approved, OWASP compliant, fast on iOS, simple | Not memory-hard (GPU/ASIC attacks easier) | ✅ Meets all REQs | Extremely mature (20+ years) | Very Low |
| Argon2id | Memory-hard (best security), PHC winner | Not FIPS approved, requires memory tuning | ✅ Better security | Mature (10 years) | Low |
| scrypt | Memory-hard, good GPU resistance | Not FIPS approved, complex parameters | ✅ Good security | Very mature | Medium |
| PBKDF2-SHA512 | Faster on 64-bit, otherwise same | Negligible advantage over SHA256 | ✅ Meets REQs | Very mature | Very Low |
| bcrypt | Good password hashing | Designed for storage not KDF, less configurable | ⚠️ Not ideal for KDF | Very mature | Low |

### 7. Scorecard (Unified 1.0–5.0 Scale)

**Weights:** Fit=0.30, Reliability/HA=0.20, Complexity/Ops=0.20, Cost/TCO=0.15, Delivery Speed=0.15

2. **scrypt**: N=32768, r=8, p=1
3. **PBKDF2**: 310K iterations minimum (600K recommended)
- Source: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html

### 9. Performance Notes
- **Key derivation time:** ~500ms acceptable for one-time login
- **Salt storage:** Store unique 128-bit salt per user
- **Iteration tuning:** Increase iterations every 2-3 years as hardware improves
- **Parallel derivation:** PBKDF2 not parallelizable (security feature)

### 10. Security, Privacy & Compliance
- **Brute-force resistance:** 600K iterations = 600K hash computations per password guess
- **Rainbow table defense:** Unique salt per user prevents pre-computation
- **GPU resistance:** PBKDF2 less resistant than Argon2id/scrypt (not memory-hard)
- **FIPS compliance:** NIST SP 800-132 approved
- **OWASP compliant:** 600K > 310K minimum

### 11. Critical Findings
- **OWASP compliance:** 600K iterations meets 2023 guidelines (310K minimum)
- **Argon2id superior:** 10-100x more expensive to attack due to memory hardness
- **Migration consideration:** Upgrade to Argon2id for new accounts
- **Performance acceptable:** Both PBKDF2 and Argon2id < 1 second on modern devices
- **Not broken:** PBKDF2 still secure, just less resistant to specialized hardware

### 12. Losers' Rationale
**Argon2id (score: 4.63):**
- **NOT actually a loser:** Better security than PBKDF2
- **Recommendation:** Upgrade to Argon2id for new accounts
- **Complexity:** Requires tuning memory parameters
- **Current choice valid:** PBKDF2 600K meets security requirements

**scrypt (score: 4.28):**
- **Memory-hard:** Good GPU resistance
- **Less popular:** Argon2id preferred (PHC winner)
- **Complex parameters:** N, r, p need tuning

**bcrypt (score: 4.33):**
- **Wrong use case:** Designed for password storage, not key derivation
- **Less flexible:** Fixed output length

### 13. Verdict
**PBKDF2-600K is acceptable** and meets OWASP 2023 requirements. However, **Argon2id is recommended** for new user accounts due to 10-100x better attack resistance. Keep PBKDF2 for existing users (migration optional).

### 14. Recommendation
**SHORT-TERM:** Keep PBKDF2-600K for existing users (OWASP compliant).  
**LONG-TERM:** Migrate to Argon2id for new accounts (Q1-Q2 2026).

**Implementation priorities:**
1. Current users: Continue PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (600K iterations)
2. New users: Offer Argon2id option (m=64MB, t=3, p=4)
3. Store KDF type with encrypted data (support both)
4. Document upgrade path for existing users

**PBKDF2 implementation:**
```swift
import CryptoKit

let password = "user_password"
let salt = Data(randomBytes: 16)  // 128-bit random salt
let iterations = 600_000

let key = try! PBKDF2<SHA256>.deriveKey(
    from: password.data(using: .utf8)!,
    salt: salt,
    iterations: iterations,
    derivedKeyLength: 32  // 256 bits
)
```

**Argon2id implementation (future):**
```swift
// Using Swift-Argon2 library
let password = "user_password"
let salt = Data(randomBytes: 16)

let key = try! Argon2id.hash(
    password: password,
    salt: salt,
    memory: 65536,  // 64 MB
    iterations: 3,
    parallelism: 4
)
```

### 15. Validation Plan (Actionable)
**Week 1: PBKDF2 Performance**
- Success criteria: Key derivation <1 second on iPhone 12 (5 years old)
- Test: Derive key with 600K iterations
- Measure: Time, CPU usage, battery impact

**Week 2: Argon2id Evaluation**
- Success criteria: Key derivation <1 second, 10x better security
- Test: Implement Argon2id, benchmark performance
- Measure: Time, memory usage, attack cost comparison

**Week 3: Salt Randomness**
- Success criteria: Unique salts for every user
- Test: Generate 1000 salts, verify all unique
- Measure: Entropy, distribution

### 16. Examples (Beginner-Friendly)

**Example 1: Why Iterations Matter**
```
Password: "password123" (weak)
Salt: random 128-bit value

PBKDF2 with 1 iteration:
Attacker tries 1 billion passwords/sec = crack in seconds

PBKDF2 with 600K iterations:
Attacker tries 1,666 passwords/sec = crack in days/weeks

Argon2id (64MB memory):
Attacker tries 100 passwords/sec = crack in months/years
```

**Example 2: Salt Prevents Pre-Computation**
```
Without salt:
Attacker precomputes PBKDF2 for common passwords
Lookup attack: instant crack

With salt:
Each user has unique salt
Attacker must compute PBKDF2 for each user separately
No precomputation possible
```

- **NO alternatives exist:** Secure Enclave is ONLY hardware-backed key storage on iOS/macOS
- **Non-negotiable:** Any alternative would be software-only (much weaker)
- **Zero extractability:** Keys generated in Enclave never leave
- **Biometric requirement:** Touch ID / Face ID provides strong 2FA
- **Platform lock-in:** Acceptable trade-off for security

### 12. Losers' Rationale
**Cloud KMS (score: 3.20):**
- **Fatal flaw:** NOT zero-knowledge (provider can access keys)
- **Wrong use case:** Designed for server-side encryption
- **Would be better for:** Multi-tenant SaaS, not Personal Vault

**libsodium/OpenSSL (score: 3.23):**
- **NO hardware protection:** Keys stored in software (extractable)
- **Malware vulnerable:** Keys readable by malware
- **Would be better for:** Cross-platform apps without hardware requirements

**YubiKey (score: 2.83):**
- **Impractical:** User must carry physical device, plug in for every operation
- **No biometric:** Requires PIN entry
- **Would be better for:** High-security desktop applications

### 13. Verdict
**Keychain + Secure Enclave is the only viable option** for iOS/macOS. Hardware-backed keys with biometric authentication, zero-knowledge architecture. No alternatives provide equivalent security on Apple platforms.

### 14. Recommendation
**KEEP** Keychain + Secure Enclave. No alternatives exist.

**Implementation priorities:**
1. Generate P-256 keys in Secure Enclave (for signing)
2. Derive AES-256 keys from user password (for encryption)
3. Store both in Keychain with biometric protection
4. Enable Cloud Keychain sync (optional, E2E encrypted)
5. Set kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly for maximum security

**Swift implementation:**
```swift
import CryptoKit
import Security

// Generate P-256 key in Secure Enclave
let accessControl = SecAccessControlCreateWithFlags(
    nil,
    kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly,
    [.privateKeyUsage, .biometryCurrentSet],
    nil
)!

let attributes: [String: Any] = [
    kSecAttrKeyType as String: kSecAttrKeyTypeECSECPrimeRandom,
    kSecAttrKeySizeInBits as String: 256,
    kSecAttrTokenID as String: kSecAttrTokenIDSecureEnclave,
    kSecPrivateKeyAttrs as String: [
        kSecAttrIsPermanent as String: true,
        kSecAttrAccessControl as String: accessControl
    ]
]

var error: Unmanaged<CFError>?
let privateKey = SecKeyCreateRandomKey(attributes as CFDictionary, &error)

// Store AES key in Keychain
let aesKey = SymmetricKey(size: .bits256)
let keyData = aesKey.withUnsafeBytes { Data($0) }

let query: [String: Any] = [
    kSecClass as String: kSecClassKey,
    kSecAttrApplicationTag as String: "com.app.encryption-key",
    kSecValueData as String: keyData,
    kSecAttrAccessControl as String: accessControl
]

SecItemAdd(query as CFDictionary, nil)
```

### 15. Validation Plan (Actionable)
**Week 1: Secure Enclave Key Generation**
- Success criteria: Generate P-256 key in Enclave
- Test: Attempt to extract key (should fail)
- Measure: Key generation time (<100ms)

**Week 2: Biometric Protection**
- Success criteria: Keys inaccessible without biometric
- Test: Try to access key without Face ID/Touch ID
- Verify: Access denied

**Week 3: Keychain Sync Testing**
- Success criteria: Keys sync across devices (E2E encrypted)
- Test: Add key on iPhone, verify appears on MacBook
- Measure: Sync latency (<5 seconds)

### 16. Examples (Beginner-Friendly)

**Example 1: How Secure Enclave Protects Keys**
```
Traditional key storage:
Key → Encrypt with password → Store in file
Risk: Malware can read file, brute-force password

Secure Enclave:
Key generated INSIDE Enclave
Key NEVER leaves Enclave
Operations performed INSIDE Enclave
Even Apple cannot extract key
```

**Example 2: Biometric Protection**
```
User sets up app:
1. Creates password
2. Derives encryption key (PBKDF2)
3. Stores key in Keychain with biometric requirement

Later, user decrypts data:
1. App requests key from Keychain
2. iOS prompts for Face ID
3. Face ID verified → Key released
4. App decrypts data

If Face ID fails:
- Key not released
- Data remains encrypted
```

## D16 — TRANSPORT SECURITY

### 1. Decision ID & Title
**D16 — Network Transport Security Protocol**

### 2. Current Choice (from Source A)
**TLS 1.3** — Transport Layer Security version 1.3 for all network communications.

### 3. Scope & Context (Plain English)
**Problem:** Need to protect data in transit between client and server (Lambda, PostgreSQL, S3, OpenAI API). Must prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Constraints:**
- Standard protocol: IETF RFC compliant
- Performance: Low latency overhead
- Security: Forward secrecy, authenticated encryption
- Compatibility: Supported by all services (AWS, OpenAI, etc.)

**Related Requirements:** Protects all network communications (REQ-2.2 data isolation).

### 4. Winner Rationale (Why this choice)
- **Industry standard:** RFC 8446, universal adoption
- **Faster than TLS 1.2:** 1-RTT handshake (50% faster connection)
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS):** Past communications secure even if key compromised
- **Authenticated encryption:** All cipher suites use AEAD (GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305)
- **Mandatory:** All major services require TLS 1.2+ (TLS 1.3 preferred)

### 5. Alternatives Considered (How they work)

**A. TLS 1.2**  
Previous version of TLS, still widely used.

**How it works:** 2-RTT handshake. Optional cipher suites include weak options (RC4, CBC). Requires careful configuration. Still secure if configured properly.

**B. mTLS (Mutual TLS)**  
TLS with client certificates for both-way authentication.

**How it works:** Server verifies client certificate, client verifies server certificate. Stronger authentication but requires certificate management. Used in zero-trust architectures.

**C. WireGuard VPN**  
Modern VPN protocol based on ChaCha20-Poly1305.

**How it works:** UDP-based VPN. Very fast (4,000 lines of code vs 100K+ for OpenVPN). Not HTTP-compatible. Would require VPN setup.

**D. SSH Tunneling**  
Secure Shell protocol for encrypted tunnels.

**How it works:** Establish SSH connection, tunnel HTTP traffic through it. Common for database connections. Not designed for web traffic.

### 6. Alternatives Comparison Table

| Option | Pros | Cons | Requirements Fit | Ecosystem/Maturity | Ops Complexity |
|--------|------|------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **TLS 1.3** (Current) | Fastest, mandatory for services, PFS, AEAD | None significant | ✅ Meets all REQs | Extremely mature (RFC 2018) | Very Low |
| TLS 1.2 | Still secure if configured well, universal | Slower (2-RTT), optional weak ciphers | ✅ Meets REQs | Very mature | Low |
| mTLS | Strongest authentication, zero-trust | Complex cert management, overkill | ⚠️ Over-engineered | Mature | High |
| WireGuard | Very fast, modern | Not HTTP-compatible, requires VPN | ❌ Protocol mismatch | Mature | Medium |
| SSH Tunneling | Good for databases, familiar | Not designed for web, overhead | ⚠️ Wrong use case | Very mature | Medium |

### 7. Scorecard (Unified 1.0–5.0 Scale)

**Weights:** Fit=0.30, Reliability/HA=0.20, Complexity/Ops=0.20, Cost/TCO=0.15, Delivery Speed=0.15

| Criterion | Weight | TLS 1.3 | TLS 1.2 | mTLS | WireGuard |
|-----------|-------:|--------:|--------:|-----:|----------:|
| Fit to requirements | 0.30 | 5.0 | 4.5 | 4.0 | 3.0 |
| Reliability/HA | 0.20 | 5.0 | 5.0 | 4.5 | 4.0 |
| Complexity/Ops | 0.20 | 5.0 | 5.0 | 2.5 | 3.5 |
| Cost/TCO | 0.15 | 5.0 | 5.0 | 4.0 | 4.5 |
| Delivery speed | 0.15 | 5.0 | 4.0 | 3.5 | 4.5 |

**Weighted Totals:**
- **TLS 1.3:** 5.00 ← **WINNER** (perfect score)
- TLS 1.2: 4.73
- mTLS: 3.68
- WireGuard: 3.63

### 8. Evidence & Benchmarks
**TLS 1.3 Performance (Date checked: 05 Oct 2025):**
- Handshake: 1-RTT (vs 2-RTT in TLS 1.2) = 50% faster
- 0-RTT resumption: Instant reconnection (with replay protection)
- Latency: ~50-100ms additional (vs plaintext)
- Adoption: 60%+ of web traffic uses TLS 1.3 (2025)
- Source: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446.html

**TLS 1.3 Security Improvements:**
- Removed: Weak cipher suites (RC4, 3DES, CBC-mode)
- Required: Forward secrecy (ephemeral Diffie-Hellman)
- Required: AEAD cipher suites only (GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305)
- Encrypted: More of handshake encrypted
- Source: RFC 8446

**Service Support (Date checked: 05 Oct 2025):**
- AWS: TLS 1.3 supported (TLS 1.2 minimum)
- OpenAI API: TLS 1.3 supported
- Google: TLS 1.3 default
- Apple: TLS 1.3 default in iOS 12.2+

### 9. Performance Notes
- **Connection overhead:** ~50-100ms for initial handshake
- **Resume (0-RTT):** No overhead for repeated connections
- **Throughput:** Negligible impact on data transfer
- **Battery:** Hardware-accelerated crypto (minimal impact)

### 10. Security, Privacy & Compliance
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy:** Ephemeral keys for each session
- **Authenticated encryption:** AEAD cipher suites mandatory
- **Certificate validation:** Prevents MITM attacks
- **No downgrade attacks:** TLS 1.3 prevents version rollback
- **PCI DSS compliant:** Required for payment card data
- **HIPAA compliant:** Adequate for healthcare data in transit

### 11. Critical Findings
- **Mandatory for services:** AWS, OpenAI, Google all require TLS 1.2+ minimum
- **TLS 1.3 preferred:** Faster, more secure, no weak cipher suites
- **Zero configuration:** URLSession (iOS) uses TLS 1.3 automatically
- **Certificate pinning:** Consider for additional MITM protection
- **No alternatives needed:** TLS 1.3 is optimal for all use cases

### 12. Losers' Rationale
**TLS 1.2 (score: 4.73):**
- **Slower:** 2-RTT handshake vs 1-RTT
- **Weaker defaults:** Optional weak cipher suites
- **Still acceptable:** If TLS 1.3 unavailable (legacy systems)

**mTLS (score: 3.68):**
- **Over-engineered:** Client certificates unnecessary for Personal Vault
- **Complexity:** Certificate issuance, renewal, revocation
- **Would be better for:** Zero-trust enterprise architectures

**WireGuard (score: 3.63):**
- **Wrong protocol:** Not HTTP-compatible
- **Additional complexity:** Would require VPN infrastructure
- **Would be better for:** Always-on VPN use cases

### 13. Verdict
**TLS 1.3 is the only option** for network transport security. Industry standard, mandatory for services, fastest, most secure. Zero configuration required (automatic in iOS URLSession).

### 14. Recommendation
**KEEP** TLS 1.3. Zero changes needed (automatic in iOS).

**Implementation notes:**
1. URLSession uses TLS 1.3 automatically (iOS 12.2+)
2. No explicit configuration required
3. Optional: Add certificate pinning for critical connections
4. Monitor: Verify TLS 1.3 being used (check server logs)

**Swift (automatic):**
```swift
// TLS 1.3 used automatically
let url = URL(string: "https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings")!
let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { data, response, error in
    // Connection secured with TLS 1.3
}
task.resume()
```

**Optional certificate pinning:**
```swift
class PinningDelegate: NSObject, URLSessionDelegate {
    func urlSession(_ session: URLSession,
                    didReceive challenge: URLAuthenticationChallenge,
                    completionHandler: @escaping (URLSession.AuthChallengeDisposition, URLCredential?) -> Void) {
        // Verify server certificate against pinned certificate
        if let serverTrust = challenge.protectionSpace.serverTrust {
            // Certificate validation logic
            completionHandler(.useCredential, URLCredential(trust: serverTrust))
        }
    }
}
```

### 15. Validation Plan (Actionable)
**Week 1: TLS Version Verification**
- Success criteria: All connections use TLS 1.3
- Test: Capture network traffic (Wireshark), verify TLS 1.3 handshake
- Measure: TLS version, cipher suite

**Week 2: Performance Testing**
- Success criteria: <100ms handshake latency
- Test: Measure connection time to OpenAI API, AWS services
- Measure: Initial connection time, resumed connection time

**Week 3: Certificate Validation**
- Success criteria: MITM attempts detected and blocked
- Test: Use proxy with self-signed certificate
- Verify: Connection fails (certificate validation working)

### 16. Examples (Beginner-Friendly)

**Example 1: TLS 1.3 vs TLS 1.2 Handshake**
```
TLS 1.2 (2-RTT):
Client → Server: ClientHello
Client ← Server: ServerHello, Certificate, KeyExchange, Done
Client → Server: KeyExchange, Finished
Client ← Server: Finished
Total: 2 round trips

TLS 1.3 (1-RTT):
Client → Server: ClientHello + KeyShare
Client ← Server: ServerHello + KeyShare + Finished + Data
Total: 1 round trip (50% faster!)
```

**Example 2: Perfect Forward Secrecy**
```
Without PFS:
- Server has single long-term private key
- Attacker records encrypted traffic
- Years later, attacker steals server key
- Attacker decrypts ALL recorded traffic

With PFS (TLS 1.3):
- Each session uses unique ephemeral keys
- Keys discarded after session
- Even if server key stolen later
- Past traffic remains encrypted (cannot decrypt)
```

## D17 — AUDIT / INTEGRITY LOGGING

### 1. Decision ID & Title
**D17 — Audit Trail and Integrity Logging System**

### 2. Current Choice (from Source A)
**Merkle Trees (SHA-256)** — Cryptographic hash tree for tamper-evident audit logging.

### 3. Scope & Context (Plain English)
**Problem:** Need to create tamper-evident audit log of all operations (message imports, encryption, access). If attacker modifies database, user should detect tampering.

**Constraints:**
- Tamper-evident: Any modification detectable
- Performance: <10ms to add log entry
- Verification: O(log n) proof size (efficient verification)
- Local-first: Works without blockchain or external services
- Privacy: Audit log doesn't expose sensitive data

**Related Requirements:** Supports REQ-2.2 (data isolation), integrity verification.

### 4. Winner Rationale (Why this choice)
- **Efficient verification:** O(log n) proof size (3KB proof for millions of entries)
- **Battle-tested:** Used by Bitcoin, Git, Certificate Transparency (billions of entries)
- **Local-first:** No blockchain/external dependencies
- **Fast operations:** 1,750-10,500 events/sec, <1ms to add entry
- **Small storage:** ~32 bytes per entry (SHA-256 hash)
- **Industry standard:** Well-understood, mature algorithms

### 5. Alternatives Considered (How they work)

**A. Blockchain**  
Distributed ledger with proof-of-work or proof-of-stake.

**How it works:** Each block contains hash of previous block. Consensus mechanism ensures immutability. Used by Bitcoin, Ethereum.

**B. Certificate Transparency**  
Google's system for auditable TLS certificate logs.

**How it works:** Merkle Tree with gossip protocol. Public append-only logs. Third-party monitors verify consistency. Used for TLS certificates.

**C. Google Trillian**  
Verifiable log infrastructure from Google.

**How it works:** Server implementation of Merkle Tree logs. Used for Certificate Transparency, Binary Transparency. Requires external server.

**D. HMAC Chain**  
Chain of HMAC tags linking each entry.

**How it works:** Each entry's HMAC includes previous HMAC. Creates chain. Tamper breaks chain.

**E. HashChain (Simple)**  
Each entry hashes previous entry + current data.

**How it works:** H(entry_n) = hash(H(entry_n-1) || data_n). Simplest tamper-evident log.

### 6. Alternatives Comparison Table

| Option | Pros | Cons | Requirements Fit | Ecosystem/Maturity | Ops Complexity |
|--------|------|------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Merkle Trees** (Current) | O(log n) proofs, efficient, battle-tested, local | Requires implementation | ✅ Meets all REQs | Extremely mature | Low |
| Blockchain | Maximum security, distributed | 10-100x slower, requires consensus, overkill | ⚠️ Over-engineered | Very mature | Extreme |
| Cert Transparency | Public auditability, gossip protocol | Requires public log servers | ❌ Not local-first | Mature | High |
| Trillian | Production-ready, Google-backed | Requires external server | ❌ Not local-first | Mature | Medium |
| HMAC Chain | Simple, fast | ❌ O(n) verification (slow for large logs) | ⚠️ Performance issue | N/A | Very Low |
| HashChain | Simplest implementation | ❌ O(n) verification, same as HMAC | ⚠️ Performance issue | N/A | Very Low |

### 7. Scorecard (Unified 1.0–5.0 Scale)

**Weights:** Fit=0.30, Reliability/HA=0.20, Complexity/Ops=0.20, Cost/TCO=0.15, Delivery Speed=0.15

| Criterion | Weight | Merkle Trees | Blockchain | HMAC Chain | Trillian |
|-----------|-------:|-------------:|-----------:|-----------:|---------:|
| Fit to requirements | 0.30 | 5.0 | 3.0 | 3.5 | 3.5 |
| Reliability/HA | 0.20 | 4.5 | 5.0 | 4.0 | 4.5 |
| Complexity/Ops | 0.20 | 4.0 | 1.0 | 5.0 | 3.0 |

| Delivery speed | 0.15 | 4.0 | 2.0 | 5.0 | 3.5 |

**Weighted Totals:**
- **Merkle Trees:** 4.50 ← **WINNER**
- HMAC Chain: 4.08 (simple but O(n) verification)
- Trillian: 3.60
- Blockchain: 2.75

### 8. Evidence & Benchmarks
**Merkle Tree Performance (Date checked: 05 Oct 2025):**
- Insert: 1,750-10,500 events/sec
- Verification: O(log n) = 20 hashes for 1M entries
- Proof size: 32 bytes * log2(n) = 640 bytes for 1M entries
- Storage: 32 bytes per entry (SHA-256)
- Source: Academic papers on Merkle Tree performance

**Blockchain Performance (Date checked: 05 Oct 2025):**
- Bitcoin: 7 transactions/sec
- Ethereum: 15-30 transactions/sec
- Query time: 200ms-6 seconds
- 10-100x slower than Merkle Trees
- Source: Blockchain.com, Etherscan

**HMAC Chain Verification:**
- Insert: O(1) = very fast
- Verify entry N: Must compute N HMACs = O(n) = slow for large logs
- Fatal flaw: Verifying 1M entries requires 1M HMAC operations

### 9. Performance Notes
- **Add entry:** <1ms (single SHA-256 hash)
- **Verify proof:** <10ms (log n hashes, ~20 for 1M entries)
- **Storage:** 32 bytes per entry
- **Proof size:** ~640 bytes for 1M entries (vs 32MB for full log)
- **Batch operations:** Can bulk-add entries, compute root once

### 10. Security, Privacy & Compliance
- **Tamper-evident:** Any modification changes root hash
- **Efficient verification:** Third party can verify with small proof
- **Privacy-preserving:** Hashes don't reveal log content
- **Non-repudiation:** Cannot deny past entries
- **No trusted third party:** Self-contained verification

### 11. Critical Findings
- **Merkle Trees optimal:** O(log n) verification crucial for large logs
- **Blockchain overkill:** Distributed consensus unnecessary for personal vault
- **HMAC/HashChain fatal flaw:** O(n) verification too slow (1M entries = 1M hashes)
- **Certificate Transparency model:** Useful reference but requires external infrastructure
- **Simple implementation:** ~200 lines of code for basic Merkle Tree

### 12. Losers' Rationale
**Blockchain (score: 2.75):**
- **Massive overkill:** Designed for distributed/adversarial networks
- **10-100x slower:** Proof-of-work/stake unnecessary
- **Would be better for:** Multi-party consensus (not needed here)

**HMAC Chain (score: 4.08):**
- **Fatal flaw:** O(n) verification (must compute all HMACs to verify)
- **Example:** Verify entry 1,000,000 = compute 1M HMACs = minutes
- **Merkle Tree:** Verify same entry = compute 20 hashes = <10ms

**Trillian (score: 3.60):**
- **External server:** Requires Google Trillian server deployment
- **Not local-first:** Defeats purpose of Personal Vault
- **Would be better for:** Public transparency logs

### 13. Verdict
**Merkle Trees are optimal** for audit logging. O(log n) verification, battle-tested (Bitcoin, Git), local-first. Blockchain is overkill (10-100x slower). HMAC/HashChain have fatal O(n) verification flaw.

### 14. Recommendation
**KEEP** Merkle Trees with SHA-256. Implement using standard algorithm.

**Implementation priorities:**
1. Log all operations (import, encrypt, decrypt, access)
2. Compute Merkle root after each batch
3. Store root in secure location (Keychain)
4. Provide verification API for users
5. Generate inclusion proofs for third-party verification

**Pseudocode:**
```python
class MerkleTree:
    def __init__(self):
        self.leaves = []
    
    def add_entry(self, data):
        # Hash the data
        leaf = sha256(data)
        self.leaves.append(leaf)
    
    def compute_root(self):
        # Build tree bottom-up
        level = self.leaves
        while len(level) > 1:
            level = [sha256(level[i] + level[i+1]) 
                     for i in range(0, len(level), 2)]
        return level[0]  # Root hash
    
    def generate_proof(self, index):
        # Generate O(log n) proof for entry at index
        proof = []
        level = self.leaves
        while len(level) > 1:
            sibling = level[index ^ 1]  # XOR to get sibling
            proof.append(sibling)
            index //= 2
            level = [sha256(level[i] + level[i+1]) 
                     for i in range(0, len(level), 2)]
        return proof
    
    def verify_proof(self, leaf, proof, root):
        # Verify leaf is in tree with given root
        hash = leaf
        for sibling in proof:
            hash = sha256(hash + sibling)
        return hash == root
```

### 15. Validation Plan (Actionable)
**Week 1: Merkle Tree Implementation**
- Success criteria: Add 10K entries, compute root in <1 second
- Test: Implement basic Merkle Tree, benchmark performance
- Measure: Insert rate, root computation time

**Week 2: Verification Testing**
- Success criteria: Verify 1M entries with <1KB proof
- Test: Generate proofs, verify inclusion
- Measure: Proof size, verification time

**Week 3: Tampering Detection**
- Success criteria: Detect any modification to log
- Test: Modify random entry, verify root changes
- Verify: All tampered entries detected

### 16. Examples (Beginner-Friendly)

**Example 1: How Merkle Trees Work**
```
4 log entries: [A, B, C, D]

Hash each entry:
H(A) = hash("User imported messages")
H(B) = hash("User encrypted database")
H(C) = hash("User accessed messages")
H(D) = hash("User exported backup")

Build tree:
         Root
        /    \
     H(AB)   H(CD)
     /  \     /  \
   H(A) H(B) H(C) H(D)

Root = hash(H(AB) + H(CD))
If anyone modifies entry C, root changes!
```

**Example 2: Efficient Verification**
```
Prove entry C is in log (1M entries):

Full log: 1M * 32 bytes = 32 MB
Merkle proof: log2(1M) * 32 bytes = 640 bytes

User stores root hash (32 bytes)
Receives proof (640 bytes)
Verifies in ~10ms (20 hash operations)

Result: 50,000x smaller proof, 100,000x faster verification
```
